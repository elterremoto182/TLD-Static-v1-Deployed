# How Often Should Drains Be Professionally Cleaned?

There is no fixed schedule. Homes with older pipes, trees near the line, or a history of [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) may benefit from annual or biennial cleaning. If you have no issues, cleaning may only be needed when a clog occurs. Knowing what influences the need for cleaning helps you decide when to schedule.

## What Influences How Often You Need Cleaning

Usage, pipe age, and past problems all affect how often drains need professional cleaning. Homes with older pipes—especially clay or cast iron—may collect more buildup and benefit from periodic cleaning. Trees near the sewer line can cause [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) that leads to recurring clogs; those homes may need annual or biennial cleaning and sometimes root treatment. A history of [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or repeated clogs suggests that buildup or roots are an ongoing issue and that preventive cleaning may help. If you have no issues—no slow drains, no backups, no odors—cleaning may only be needed when a clog occurs. A [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can show pipe condition—roots, scale, bellied pipe—and help you and your plumber decide how often to clean.

[Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) can clear blockages. A sewer camera inspection can show pipe condition and help you decide how often to clean. Schedule an inspection to get a recommendation tailored to your situation.

## Signs You Need Cleaning Sooner

Do not wait for a full backup to schedule cleaning. If drains are slowing down, gurgling, or emitting odor, or if you have had one backup already, schedule [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) or a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) sooner rather than later. Catching a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) early often means one cleaning or a small repair instead of an emergency and a larger bill. If you are unsure whether you need cleaning, an inspection can show buildup, roots, or pipe condition and give you a clear recommendation.

## Summary

There is no fixed schedule; it depends on usage, pipe age, and past problems. Homes with older pipes or trees near the line may benefit from annual or biennial cleaning. Schedule a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) to see pipe condition and get a recommendation for how often to clean.
