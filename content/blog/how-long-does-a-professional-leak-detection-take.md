# How Long Does a Professional Leak Detection Take?

Most residential leak detection visits take one to a few hours, depending on the size of the home and how many areas need to be checked. Complex [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) situations may take longer. Your technician can give a more specific estimate once they understand your layout and the suspected location of the leak.

## What Affects the Length of the Visit

The time required depends on the size of the home, the number of suspected areas (for example, one wall versus multiple zones or a full slab), and whether multiple methods are needed. A single suspected leak in a known area might be located in an hour or less. A larger home, multiple possible leak zones, or a slab leak with limited access may require two to four hours or more. Some visits also include a written report or markout, which may be prepared on site or shortly after.

[Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) locates the source without guesswork, so the time invested is focused on finding the leak rather than exploratory demolition. Schedule an inspection and ask your technician for an estimated time based on your situation so you can plan accordingly.

## How to Prepare for the Visit

To help the visit go smoothly, have information ready about where you notice signs—which rooms, which walls or areas of floor, and when the signs started or changed. If you have a copy of your water bill showing an increase, that can help. Make sure the technician has access to the areas they need—clear furniture or rugs if they might block access to walls or floors. If you have a cleanout or know where the main line enters the home, point that out. The more context you provide, the more efficiently the technician can focus the inspection.

## When You Will Get Results

Most technicians will give you a verbal summary on site—where the leak is (or that no active leak was found) and what they recommend. Many also provide a written report or markout, either before they leave or within a short time after. Ask when you schedule whether a report is included and when to expect it, especially if you need it for insurance or for a plumber who will do the repair. Having the location documented helps you get accurate repair quotes and ensures the fix is targeted.

## Summary

Most residential leak detection visits take one to a few hours, depending on the size of the home, the number of areas to check, and whether multiple methods are needed. Your technician can give a more specific estimate when you schedule or on site. Plan for a half-day window so you are not rushed, and ask when to expect a report or summary of findings.
