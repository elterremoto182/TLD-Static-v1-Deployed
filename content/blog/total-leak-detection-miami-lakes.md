The following is a video of a leak detection in Miami Lakes Florida.

Did you know that the average household wastes [10,000 gallons](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802034136/https://www.epa.gov/watersense/fix-leak-week) of water each year from leaks?

Although the water supply is plentiful in South Florida, no one wants to be wasteful. The last thing you want to deal with is an expensive water bill or—even worse—a plumbing emergency in your home.

Do you suspect a leak lurking inside your home, but you’re not sure how to track it down? The Total Leak Detection Company is here to do the detective work for you.

Keep reading to learn who we are and why we’re the best at water leak detection in homes.

## Why Choose Us?

When you don’t feel well, you visit the doctor. After a checkup, the doctor might send you to a specialist for further testing and diagnosis.

The same principle is true for a water leak lurking in your home. An ordinary plumber may not have the expertise or equipment needed to make a proper diagnosis.

So what makes us different? We are the “specialists” that use the latest non-invasive, state-of-the-art technology to identify and fix hidden water leaks.

## Leak Detection in Miami Lakes

Our family has been involved in the plumbing industry for over 45 years, back when [Miami Lakes](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802034136/https://www.miamilakeschamber.com/about-miami-lakes.html) was a humble dairy farm.

Although planning for Miami Lakes began in the 1960s, the town wasn’t officially incorporated until 2000. This makes it one of the “youngest” cities in Miami-Dade County.

Today Miami Lakes is a thriving community made up of [over 31,000 residents](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802034136/https://www.miamilakes-fl.gov/index.php) and 1,700 businesses. We’re proud to serve families in Miami Lakes, Doral, and the greater Miami area.

## Professional House Water Leak Detection

Here’s a quick overview of the three main leak detection services we provide.

### Leak Detection Services

Aside from a visual inspection of exposed pipes, we [use sound and radar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802034136//leak-detection-services/) to find leaks invisible to the naked eye.

Leaks produce sounds at different frequencies, based on the location, content, and pressure. Our equipment registers sounds from your plumbing and transmits those sounds to a secure database.

This allows us to triangulate the exact position of any leak—guaranteed!

### Sewer Camera Inspections

Even the smallest homes and buildings have hundreds of feet of hidden pipes. The only way to find out exactly what’s happening inside is with a [sewer camera inspection](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802034136//sewer-camera-inspections/).

Using an HD camera attached to a specialized rod, we can check every inch of plumbing on your property to identify the source of the problem. Better yet, we’ll provide you with a digital recording and report you can use for future repair work or for your insurance company.

### Plumbing Report Writing

Do you need to inform a client or other relevant parties about a plumbing problem on their property? Don’t leave it to guesswork.

Make sure you provide a full and accurate diagnosis by ordering a [plumbing inspection report](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802034136//plumbing-report-writing/). Not only does this build trust and confidence with your clients, but it gives your team legal protection.
