# How Long Does a Sewer Camera Inspection Take?

Most residential sewer camera inspections take 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the length of the line and ease of access. You typically get a verbal summary on site and may receive a written report or video afterward. Knowing what to expect helps you plan your day and know when you will get results.

## What Affects the Length of the Inspection

The time required depends on how long your main sewer line is (from the cleanout or access point to the street connection), how easy it is to access the cleanout, and what the technician finds. A typical single-family home line might be 50 to 150 feet; running the camera in and out and documenting findings usually takes 30 minutes to an hour. If access is difficult—for example, the cleanout is buried or blocked—setup may take longer. If the camera encounters a severe blockage or collapse, the technician may not be able to pass the full length and will report what was seen. You typically get a verbal summary on site and may receive a written report or video afterward.

[Professional sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) helps diagnose [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) and [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/). Schedule an inspection and ask your technician for an estimated time so you can plan accordingly.

## What You Get When the Inspection Is Done

When the inspection is complete, the technician will usually give you a verbal summary of what they saw—for example, clear pipe, roots, cracks, or collapse—and the approximate location of any issues. Many companies provide a written report and sometimes video or still images. That documentation is useful for repair quotes, insurance, or real estate. Ask when you schedule whether a report or video is included and when you will receive it so you can plan next steps (cleaning, repair, or replacement) without delay.

## Summary

Most residential sewer camera inspections take 30 minutes to an hour. You typically get a verbal summary on site and may receive a report or video afterward. Ask your technician for an estimated time when you schedule so you can plan your day.
