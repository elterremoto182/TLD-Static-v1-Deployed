  - question: Can mold testing miss hidden mold?
    answer: 'Yes. Surface or air sampling alone can miss mold growing behind walls, under flooring, or in other inaccessible areas. A thorough assessment—including moisture mapping, thermal imaging, or strategic sampling—reduces the risk. Professional mold testing can recommend the right approach for your situation.'

# Can Mold Testing Miss Hidden Mold?

Yes. Surface or air sampling alone can miss mold behind walls or under flooring. A thorough assessment—including moisture mapping, thermal imaging, or strategic sampling—reduces the risk of missing [hidden mold](/problems/hidden-mold/). Knowing the limits of testing helps you choose the right approach.

## When Testing May Miss Hidden Mold

Mold behind walls, under flooring, or in HVAC systems is out of sight. A single air sample in the middle of a room may not capture spores from a small, enclosed cavity. Surface sampling only finds mold on the surfaces that are sampled—so if mold is growing on the back of drywall or inside a wall cavity, surface sampling alone may miss it. For that reason, a limited or poorly placed sampling plan can miss hidden mold.

A thorough assessment reduces the risk. Moisture mapping and thermal imaging can identify areas of dampness that may indicate mold behind walls or under flooring. Strategic air sampling—including near suspected areas or after disturbing a wall cavity—can capture elevated spores. In some cases, bulk sampling (a small piece of material) from a strategic location can confirm mold inside a wall. [Professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) can recommend the right approach for [water damage mold](/problems/water-damage-mold/) and other situations. If you suspect mold in inaccessible areas, schedule an inspection so a comprehensive plan can be designed.

## What to Ask For When You Schedule

When you schedule [professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) and you suspect [hidden mold](/problems/hidden-mold/) behind walls or under flooring, ask how the assessor will address inaccessible areas. A thorough assessment should include a discussion of your symptoms (odor, water damage history, staining), moisture mapping or thermal imaging if appropriate, and a sampling plan that targets suspected areas—not just a single room air sample. That approach increases the chance of finding hidden mold and gives you a clearer picture of what needs to be remediated.

## Summary

Mold testing can miss hidden mold if only limited surface or air samples are used. A thorough assessment with moisture mapping, thermal imaging, and strategic sampling reduces that risk. Schedule [professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) and ask for a comprehensive plan if you suspect mold behind walls or in other inaccessible areas.
