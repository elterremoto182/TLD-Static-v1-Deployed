    answer: 'Leak detection is most effective on active leaks—when water is flowing and making sound or creating temperature differences. Old or inactive leaks may leave stains or moisture that thermal imaging can detect, but the exact source is easier to find when the leak is active. If a leak has stopped, running water to that line may reactivate it for detection.'

# Can Leak Detection Identify Old or Inactive Leaks?

Leak detection works best when a leak is active—water is flowing and can be heard or seen with thermal imaging. Old or inactive leaks may leave stains or moisture that can be inspected, but the exact source is easier to find when water is running. That does not mean detection is useless for past leaks; it means the technician may need to work with what is left behind or temporarily reactivate the line.

## Why Active Leaks Are Easier to Find

Acoustic leak detection relies on the sound of water escaping from the pipe. When no water is flowing, there is little or no sound to detect. Thermal imaging can show temperature differences caused by moisture or wet materials, so it can sometimes reveal areas where a leak occurred or where moisture remains—but pinpointing the exact break in the pipe is more reliable when water is flowing. Electronic correlators also need an active leak signal to calculate location. For these reasons, technicians prefer to run water to the suspected line during the inspection when possible.

[Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) can still assess [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) history and recommend next steps. The technician may use thermal imaging to look for residual moisture or stains, and they can advise whether running water to that line would help locate the source. If you had a leak that stopped, schedule an inspection and ask whether reactivating the line is safe and useful for your situation.

## What Technicians Do When the Leak Is Inactive

When the leak is not currently flowing, the technician may still be able to narrow down the area. Thermal imaging can show cool or warm spots where moisture has accumulated or where a past leak left the materials damp. Visual inspection of stains, soft drywall, or warped flooring can point to a general zone. In some cases, the technician will recommend running water to the suspected line—for example, turning on a fixture or opening a valve—for a period before or during the inspection so the leak becomes active enough to detect. That approach is common when the leak is intermittent or when the water has been off for a while. Your technician can explain the best approach for your situation.

## Why It Still Matters to Find Old Leak Sources

Even if a leak has stopped, finding the source is important. The pipe or fitting is still damaged; the next time water runs through that line, the leak can start again. Left unrepaired, the same spot can cause repeated water damage, mold, and higher bills. Locating the source—whether the leak is active during the inspection or inferred from moisture and damage—allows you to schedule a single repair and avoid repeated problems. Schedule an inspection so you can get a clear recommendation and plan the repair.

## What to Tell the Technician When You Schedule

When you schedule [professional leak detection](/leak-detection/), mention if the leak is intermittent or if the water has been off for a while. The technician may ask you to run water to the suspected line before or during the visit so the leak can be activated for acoustic or thermal detection. They can also explain whether they can work from residual moisture and damage alone if running water is not possible. Giving that context helps them choose the right approach for your [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) situation and improves the chance of a clear, actionable result.
