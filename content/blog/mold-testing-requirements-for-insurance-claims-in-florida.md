# Mold Testing Requirements for Insurance Claims in Florida

Some Florida insurers require mold testing or post-remediation clearance reports for water damage claims. Requirements vary by carrier; your adjuster can tell you what documentation they need. Knowing common requirements helps you schedule testing in time and avoid claim delays.

## What Insurers May Require

When you file a water damage claim that involves or may involve mold, your insurer may ask for proof of the extent of mold and sometimes the cause. That can mean a mold assessment report—air and sometimes surface or bulk sampling—that identifies what mold is present and where. After remediation, many insurers require a post-remediation clearance report from a qualified assessor stating that the area is clear and safe. Requirements vary by carrier and policy; some policies have sublimits or exclusions for mold, and some require that you use a licensed mold assessor. Your adjuster can tell you what documentation they need and by when.

[Professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) can provide reports for [water damage mold](/problems/water-damage-mold/) or [hidden mold](/problems/hidden-mold/) claims. Schedule testing early so you have the documentation your insurer may require, and ask for a written report that meets your carrier's requirements.

## What to Ask Your Adjuster and Your Testing Company

When you open a water damage claim, ask your adjuster whether mold testing or a clearance report is required, by when, and whether they need a licensed mold assessor. When you hire a [professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) company, ask whether their reports meet typical insurer requirements—for example, lab results, sampling locations, and a clear pass/fail or finding summary. Some carriers have specific forms or wording they want in the report. Getting the requirements from your insurer first and then sharing them with the testing company helps ensure you receive documentation that your carrier will accept and avoids delays or denials for incomplete paperwork.

## Summary

Some Florida insurers require mold testing or post-remediation clearance reports for water damage claims. Requirements vary by carrier—ask your adjuster what is needed. Schedule [professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) early and request a written report that meets your insurer's requirements to avoid claim delays.
