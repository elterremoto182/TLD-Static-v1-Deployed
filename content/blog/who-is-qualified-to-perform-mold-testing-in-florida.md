# Who Is Qualified to Perform Mold Testing in Florida?

In Florida, mold assessors (who inspect and test) and remediators (who remove mold) are licensed by the state. For mold testing, look for a licensed mold assessor or a company that uses licensed assessors. Knowing who is qualified helps you hire the right professional and get a valid assessment.

## Florida Licensing for Mold Assessors

Florida law requires mold assessors and mold remediators to be licensed. A mold assessor is the professional who inspects for mold, designs the sampling plan, collects samples, and interprets results—in other words, the one who performs mold testing. A mold remediator is the one who removes or contains the mold. In many cases, the same company does not do both (to avoid conflict of interest); the assessor tests, and a separate remediator does the cleanup. When you hire for mold testing, confirm that the person performing the assessment is a licensed mold assessor. You can verify licensure through the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR).

[Professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) can provide [water damage mold](/problems/water-damage-mold/) and [hidden mold](/problems/hidden-mold/) assessments. When hiring, confirm the assessor is licensed and ask for a clear scope of work and a written report.

## What to Look For When Hiring

When you contact a mold testing company, ask for the name and license number of the person who will perform the assessment. You can verify that the license is current and in good standing on the Florida DBPR website. Also ask what the assessment includes—for example, visual inspection, moisture mapping, number of air and surface samples, and whether you will receive a written report with lab results. A clear scope of work and a report that states the findings in plain language help you understand what was found and what to do next. Avoid anyone who offers to do both testing and remediation on the same job; using a separate assessor for testing is the standard and often required for valid clearance.

## Summary

In Florida, mold testing must be performed by a licensed mold assessor. Verify licensure through the Florida DBPR and ask for a written report. Schedule [professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) with a licensed assessor for valid assessments that meet state requirements.
