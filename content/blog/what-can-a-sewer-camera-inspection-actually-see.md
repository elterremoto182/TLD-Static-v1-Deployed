# What Can a Sewer Camera Inspection Actually See?

A sewer camera inspection shows the inside of your sewer line—cracks, breaks, roots, blockages, offset joints, and scale buildup. The technician views the footage in real time and can pinpoint the location and type of problem. Knowing what the camera can and cannot see helps you set realistic expectations and plan next steps.

## What the Camera Reveals

A small, waterproof camera is fed into the sewer line on a flexible cable, usually through a cleanout or toilet access. The camera sends live video to a monitor, so the technician can see the interior of the pipe as the camera travels. Cracks, breaks, and holes in the pipe wall are visible. Tree roots that have entered through joints or cracks show up clearly—often as dense, hairlike or root-like growth. Blockages—grease, debris, or collapsed pipe—are visible. Offset or separated joints (where two pipe sections have shifted) can be seen. Scale buildup, corrosion, and bellied pipe (sagging sections that hold water) are also detectable. The technician can measure distance from the access point so the location of any problem is documented for repair.

[Professional sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) helps diagnose [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) and [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) before costly repairs. Schedule an inspection if you have slow drains, backups, or odors so you know exactly what is inside the line.

## What the Camera Cannot Do

The camera shows the interior of the pipe; it does not repair the line. If the line is completely blocked or collapsed, the camera may not be able to pass beyond the blockage, so the technician will report what was seen up to that point. The camera also cannot see outside the pipe—for example, it will not show the exact location of the pipe under the ground or whether tree roots are approaching from the outside until they have entered. For repair planning, the distance measurement from the access point helps locate the problem; the technician may need to use that measurement and surface landmarks to guide excavation or repair. Despite these limits, a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) remains the best way to see what is inside the line without digging.

## Summary

A sewer camera inspection shows the inside of your sewer line—cracks, roots, blockages, offset joints, and more—in real time. The technician can pinpoint the location and type of problem for repair. Schedule an inspection if you have slow drains, backups, or odors so you can plan the right fix.
