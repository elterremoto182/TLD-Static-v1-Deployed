# Can Insurance Deny a Claim Without Leak Detection?

Some insurers may deny or delay a water damage claim if the cause and location of the leak are not documented. Professional leak detection provides a report that identifies the source, which can support your claim. Knowing how leak detection fits into the claims process helps you protect your interests.

## Why Insurers May Ask for Documentation

Water damage claims often require proof of what caused the damage and where it originated. If the cause is unclear—for example, you have water damage but no visible leak—the insurer may question whether the damage was sudden and accidental (often covered) or long-term or maintenance-related (sometimes excluded or limited). A professional leak detection report that identifies the source of the leak, its location, and often whether it was active can provide that documentation. Without it, some insurers may deny or delay the claim for lack of evidence.

[Leak detection services](/leak-detection/) document findings for [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) and [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) situations. If you are filing a water damage claim, schedule an inspection and keep the report for your insurer. The report can support your claim and help avoid denial for lack of evidence.

## When to Schedule Detection in the Claims Process

Schedule leak detection as soon as you have water damage and plan to file a claim—ideally before or early in the claims process. The report can be included with your claim to show the cause and location of the damage. Do not wait for the insurer to ask; providing documentation upfront can speed up the process and reduce the chance of denial or delay. If the insurer later requests proof of the leak source, you will already have it.

## What to Include in the Report for Your Insurer

Ask your [leak detection](/leak-detection/) provider for a written report that states the leak location, cause (e.g., pipe failure, joint leak), and whether the leak was active at the time of the inspection. Photos or diagrams that show the leak source and affected areas can strengthen your claim. Keep copies for your records and submit the report with your claim or as soon as the insurer requests documentation. A clear, professional report reduces the chance of denial for lack of evidence and helps the adjuster process your claim efficiently.

## Summary

Some insurers may deny or delay a water damage claim without documentation of the leak source. Professional leak detection provides a report that identifies the cause and location, which can support your claim. Schedule an inspection when filing a claim and keep the report for your insurer.
