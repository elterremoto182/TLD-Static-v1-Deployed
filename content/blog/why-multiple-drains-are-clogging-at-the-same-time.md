# Why Multiple Drains Are Clogging at the Same Time

When multiple drains clog at once, the problem is usually in the main line—a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) that affects all fixtures. A single clogged fixture is often a local blockage; multiple clogs point to the main. Knowing the difference helps you call for the right service and avoid treating the wrong area.

## Why Multiple Clogs Point to the Main Line

All fixtures in the home—toilets, sinks, showers, tubs—drain into the main sewer line that runs from the house to the street or septic tank. If only one fixture is slow or backing up, the problem is often in that fixture's branch—for example, a clog in the toilet drain or the kitchen sink line. When multiple fixtures are slow or backing up at the same time, the blockage is usually downstream of all of them—in the main line. That can be a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) (grease, debris, roots), [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) (roots growing into the pipe), or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) (a section of pipe that has failed). Clearing the main line—with snaking or hydro jetting—restores flow to all fixtures. A [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can show what is causing the blockage so you can choose the right fix.

[Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) can clear the main line. A sewer camera inspection can show what is causing the blockage. Schedule an inspection if several drains are slow or backing up so you can address the main line and avoid repeated clogs.

## Do Not Try to Clear Each Drain Separately

Pouring chemicals down each slow drain or snaking only one fixture will not fix a main line [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/). The blockage is downstream of all fixtures, so you need to clear the main line—usually via the main cleanout—with [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) (snaking or hydro jetting). A [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can confirm what is blocking the main line so you can choose the right method and avoid repeated callouts. Addressing the main line once usually restores flow to all drains and is more effective than treating fixtures one by one.

## Summary

When multiple drains clog at once, the problem is usually in the main line. Schedule [drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) to clear the line and a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) to see the cause so you can plan the right fix and avoid repeated clogs.
