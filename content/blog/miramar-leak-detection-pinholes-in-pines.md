It was named after the [Miramar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramar,_Havana) area of [Havana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana), [Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba). Miramar translates to “look at the sea” in Spanish. At the time of incorporation, the city had a population of fewer than two hundred people.

In addition, homes that are not properly grounded could be a cause.
