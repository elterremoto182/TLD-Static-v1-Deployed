    answer: 'No. Black mold (Stachybotrys and similar species) is identified using the same air, surface, or bulk sampling methods as other molds. The lab identifies the species, and the report may note health or remediation implications. Professional mold testing can recommend the right sampling for your situation.'

# Does Black Mold Require Different Testing?

No. Black mold (Stachybotrys and similar species) is identified with the same air, surface, or bulk sampling as other molds. The lab identifies the species and the report may note health or remediation implications. The sampling methods are the same; the difference is in how the results are interpreted and what the report may say about the type of mold found.

## How Black Mold Is Identified

Black mold is a common term for Stachybotrys chartarum and similar dark-colored molds that can grow on very wet, cellulose-rich materials. They are identified using the same methods as other molds: air samples capture spores in the air, surface or tape-lift samples collect mold from a surface, and bulk samples (pieces of material) can be analyzed for mold growth. The lab identifies the species and reports what types of mold are present. The report may note whether Stachybotrys or other species of concern were found and may include guidance on health or remediation. Remediation protocols for Stachybotrys may be more stringent in some guidelines because of the potential for mycotoxins, but the testing itself is the same.

[Professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) can recommend the right sampling for [water damage mold](/problems/water-damage-mold/) or [hidden mold](/problems/hidden-mold/). If you suspect black mold, schedule testing to confirm what is present and get a clear report on species and next steps.

## Why You Should Not Rely on Color Alone

"Black mold" is often used to mean Stachybotrys, but many molds appear dark or black and only lab analysis can identify the species. What looks black on a wall may be another mold entirely. [Professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) with air, surface, or bulk sampling and lab identification gives you an accurate species report so you know what you are dealing with and can follow the right remediation guidance. Avoid skipping testing because you "know it's black mold"—getting a proper identification ensures appropriate cleanup and documentation for health or insurance concerns.

## Summary

No—black mold (Stachybotrys) is identified with the same air, surface, or bulk sampling as other molds. The lab identifies the species and the report may note health or remediation implications. Schedule [professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) if you suspect black mold to get a clear report on what is present and recommended next steps.
