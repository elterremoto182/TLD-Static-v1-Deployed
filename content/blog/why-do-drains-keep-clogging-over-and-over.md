# Why Do Drains Keep Clogging Over and Over?

Recurring clogs often mean a partial blockage remains, [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) in the line, or a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) that was not fully cleared. A one-time snake may not fix the underlying cause. Understanding why clogs keep coming back helps you choose the right fix and avoid repeated cleanings.

## Common Causes of Recurring Clogs

When a clog returns soon after cleaning, the cleaning may have opened a path through the blockage without fully removing it—for example, grease, roots, or debris that builds up again. [Root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) is a common cause of recurring clogs: roots grow into the pipe through cracks or joints, and snaking may cut them temporarily, but they grow back unless the roots are treated or the damaged section is repaired. A bellied pipe—a sagging section that holds water and debris—can cause repeated blockages because waste collects in the low spot. A [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) that was only partially cleared can also lead to repeat clogs. A one-time snake may not fix the underlying cause; hydro jetting or repair may be needed.

[Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) can clear blockages and, when needed, a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can show what is causing repeat clogs—roots, bellied pipe, or partial blockage. Schedule an inspection if clogs keep coming back so you can address the root cause.

## Why a One-Time Snake Often Isn't Enough

A standard snake can punch through a clog and restore flow, but it may not remove all the material—especially grease, roots, or debris that has built up over time. Roots can grow back after being cut, and a bellied pipe will keep collecting waste. Hydro jetting uses high-pressure water to scour the inside of the pipe and remove more buildup than a snake alone. For structural issues like roots or a belly, a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) shows exactly what is there so you can choose root treatment, spot repair, or replacement. Investing in the right fix once usually costs less than repeated snaking and avoids the frustration of clogs that keep returning.

## Summary

Recurring clogs often mean a partial blockage, roots, or a pipe problem that was not fully fixed. A [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can show the cause so you can choose the right fix—cleaning, root treatment, or repair. Schedule an inspection if clogs keep coming back.
