# When Should You Call a Leak Detection Specialist?

Call a leak detection specialist when you notice unexplained high water bills, sounds of running water when nothing is on, damp or warm spots on floors, stains or mold, or a meter that moves with all water off. Do not wait if you suspect a [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/). The right time to call is as soon as you have reason to believe a hidden leak exists—before damage spreads and repair costs rise.

## Signs That Warrant a Call

The most common signs that you should schedule a leak detection inspection include a sudden or steady rise in your water bill with no change in usage, the sound of running or dripping water when all fixtures are off, and damp or warm spots on floors—especially over a slab. Stains on walls or ceilings, peeling paint, or mold growth in the absence of an obvious spill or leak also suggest hidden moisture. If you check your water meter with everything off and it still moves, you likely have a leak somewhere in the system.

In regions like South Florida, slab leaks and pinhole leaks in copper pipes are common; early detection limits foundation and structural damage. [Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) locates the source without guesswork so repairs can be targeted and less invasive.

## When Not to Wait

If water is actively flooding, spreading quickly, or you see significant pooling, shut off the main water supply and call for emergency service—that may be a plumber or leak detection team depending on your provider. For slower, hidden leaks, scheduling an inspection as soon as you suspect a problem is the best way to limit damage and repair cost. The longer a leak goes unrepaired, the more it can affect flooring, walls, and in the case of slab leaks, foundation stability. Schedule an inspection at the first sign of trouble rather than waiting for the problem to worsen.

## What to Expect When You Call

When you call a leak detection specialist, they will typically ask about your signs—high bills, sounds, damp spots, odors—and may ask about the age of your home and plumbing. They can often schedule an on-site visit within a few days. The visit usually takes one to a few hours, depending on the size of the home and the number of suspected areas. After the inspection, you should receive a clear report or markout showing where the leak is (and often whether it is active), so you can share it with your plumber or repair team and plan the next step.

## Why Calling Early Matters

The longer a hidden leak goes unrepaired, the more damage it can cause. Water that seeps into walls, floors, or under the slab can lead to mold growth, rot, stains, and in the case of slab leaks, foundation movement or cracks. Your water bill will also reflect the ongoing waste. Calling as soon as you have reason to suspect a leak—rather than waiting for obvious damage—limits the scope of repair and often reduces the total cost. If you are on the fence, schedule the inspection; the technician can confirm whether a leak is present and where it is, so you can make an informed decision about repair.

## What If the Technician Finds No Leak?

If the inspection finds no active leak, you still benefit from having ruled it out. The technician may identify another cause for your signs—for example, condensation, a past leak that was repaired, or a fixture that needs adjustment. You will have a report documenting the findings, which can be useful for insurance or peace of mind. If signs persist later, you can schedule a follow-up. [Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) gives you a clear answer so you are not left guessing about [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) risk.
