# Does Leak Detection Find Leaks Under Concrete?

Yes. Professional leak detection can find leaks under concrete using acoustic listening, thermal imaging, and electronic correlators. Technicians pinpoint the location so repairs can be targeted instead of tearing up the whole slab. That approach saves time, cost, and disruption compared to exploratory jackhammering.

## How Leaks Under Slabs Are Located

Leaks under concrete slabs—often called slab leaks—occur in water or sewer lines embedded in or below the foundation. Professional leak detection locates them without jackhammering the entire floor. Acoustic listening devices detect the sound of water escaping from the pipe; technicians may place sensors at access points (such as cleanouts or fixture connections) and use correlators to calculate the leak position along the line. Thermal imaging can sometimes reveal temperature patterns on the slab surface caused by water flow or moisture beneath. Electronic pipe tracing helps map the route of pipes under the slab so the leak location can be narrowed down.

Once the leak is pinpointed, repair can be limited to a small section of slab—often a single access point—instead of removing large areas of concrete. [Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) is used for [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) and [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) under foundations. If you suspect a leak under your slab, schedule an inspection to locate it before repair so the work can be targeted and less invasive.

## What If the Leak Is Hard to Pinpoint?

In some cases—very thick slabs, multiple pipes in the same area, or low flow from the leak—the technician may need to use more than one method or run water to the line to improve detection. They may also need access to cleanouts or fixture connections to place sensors. If your home has limited access points, the technician can explain what is possible and whether a second visit (for example, after opening one small access) might be needed. In most residential slab leak situations, acoustic and thermal methods are enough to narrow the location to a small area for repair.

## Why Locating Before Repair Saves Money

Jackhammering the slab in several places to "find" the leak is costly and disruptive. [Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) narrows the location first so the plumber or repair crew can open one targeted section of concrete, make the repair, and close it. That usually means one access point instead of multiple exploratory openings, lower labor and material cost, and less time with your floor torn up. If you have signs of a [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/)—warm spots, high bills, or sounds of water—schedule detection before any concrete work so the repair can be planned around a known location.

## Summary

Yes—professional leak detection can find leaks under concrete using acoustic, thermal, and electronic methods without jackhammering the whole slab. That approach saves time, cost, and disruption. Schedule an inspection if you have signs of a slab leak—warm spots on the floor, high water bills, or sounds of running water when nothing is on—so the leak can be located and repaired in a targeted way.
