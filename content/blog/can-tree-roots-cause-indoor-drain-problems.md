    answer: 'Yes. Tree roots can enter the main sewer line through cracks or joints and cause blockages, slow drains, backups, and gurgling in indoor fixtures. The main line runs from the house to the street, so roots in that line affect all drains. Professional drain cleaning or hydro jetting can clear roots; a sewer camera inspection can confirm root intrusion.'

# Can Tree Roots Cause Indoor Drain Problems?

Yes. Tree roots can enter the main sewer line through cracks or joints and cause [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) that leads to slow drains, backups, and gurgling indoors. The main line serves all fixtures, so roots in that line affect the whole house. Understanding how roots cause indoor drain problems helps you recognize the signs and when to schedule drain cleaning or a sewer camera inspection.

## How Roots Affect Indoor Drains

The main sewer line runs from the house to the street or septic tank. All indoor fixtures—toilets, sinks, showers, tubs—drain into that main line. Tree roots seek moisture and nutrients and can grow into the main line through small cracks or at pipe joints. Once inside, roots can branch and fill the pipe, causing blockages. When the main line is partially or fully blocked by roots, wastewater cannot flow out normally, so you notice slow drains, backups, or gurgling in multiple fixtures indoors. The problem is in the main line, but the symptoms show up inside the home. [Root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) often recurs because snaking may cut roots temporarily, but they grow back unless the roots are treated or the damaged section is repaired.

[Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) or hydro jetting can clear roots. A [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can confirm [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) and root intrusion. Schedule an inspection if you have trees near the line and recurring clogs so you can address the root cause.

## Reducing the Chance of Roots in the Future

After clearing [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), root treatment (foam or chemical applied to the line) can slow regrowth. Long-term, repairing cracks or damaged joints where roots entered reduces the chance of recurrence. If roots have caused [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) or severe damage, that section may need repair or replacement. A [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) shows where roots entered and how bad the damage is so you can decide between cleaning with root treatment and repair. If you have mature trees near the main line, consider periodic [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) or inspection to catch roots early before they cause a full blockage.

## Summary

Yes—tree roots in the main sewer line can cause slow drains, backups, and gurgling indoors because the main line serves all fixtures. Schedule [drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) or a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) if you have trees near the line and recurring clogs so you can address the cause.
