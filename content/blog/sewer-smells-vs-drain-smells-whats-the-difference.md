# Sewer Smells vs Drain Smells: What's the Difference?

Sewer smells—strong, sewage-like odor—often come from the main line or a vent problem, and can indicate a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or break. Drain smells—local to one fixture—can be from a dry trap or buildup in that drain. Knowing the difference helps you decide whether to call for drain cleaning or a sewer camera inspection.

## Sewer Smells: Main Line or Vent Issues

Sewer smells that seem to come from multiple fixtures or from the yard often point to the main sewer line or the vent system. A break or leak in the main line can allow sewer gas to escape into the yard or into the home through the soil. A blocked or damaged vent stack can prevent sewer gas from escaping through the roof, so it backs up into the home. Strong, persistent sewage odor in more than one room or in the yard suggests a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/), [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/), or break. A [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can confirm what is wrong; [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) may clear blockages, but if the problem is a break or collapse, repair is needed.

## Drain Smells: Dry Trap or Buildup

Drain smells that are local to one fixture—for example, one sink or shower—are often caused by a dry trap (the U-shaped section under the fixture that holds water to block sewer gas; if it dries out, gas can enter) or buildup in that drain. Running water to refill the trap or cleaning that specific drain may resolve the odor. If the smell persists or appears in multiple areas, the cause may be in the main line. [Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) can clear blockages that cause odors. If [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) or pipe collapse is suspected, a sewer camera inspection can confirm. Schedule an inspection if odors persist.

## When to Call a Professional for Odors

If refilling a trap or cleaning one drain does not fix the smell, or if the odor is strong and widespread, schedule [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) or a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/). Persistent sewer odor can indicate a break, [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/), or [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) that needs more than a DIY fix. A camera inspection can locate the source so you can choose the right repair—cleaning, root treatment, or pipe repair—and restore normal venting and flow.

## Summary

Sewer smells (strong, sewage-like) often point to the main line or vent; drain smells (local to one fixture) can be a dry trap or buildup. For persistent or widespread odors, schedule [drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) or a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) to find and fix the cause.
