# What Does Post-Remediation Mold Clearance Mean?

Post-remediation mold clearance is testing done after mold removal to confirm the area is clean and safe. Air and sometimes surface samples are taken and compared to baseline or outdoor levels to verify remediation was successful. Clearance is the final step that confirms the space is ready for reoccupation or that no further remediation is needed.

## What Clearance Testing Involves

After mold remediation is complete, a qualified inspector—often a third party, not the remediator—performs a visual inspection and collects air samples and sometimes surface samples in the remediated area. The samples are sent to a lab for analysis. Results are compared to outdoor baseline levels or to pre-remediation levels. If spore counts and types are within acceptable limits and no visible mold remains, the area is typically considered clear. The inspector may also check that moisture levels are acceptable so mold is unlikely to return. A written report documents the results and usually states whether the area passed clearance.

[Professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) can perform clearance testing after [water damage mold](/problems/water-damage-mold/) or [hidden mold](/problems/hidden-mold/) remediation. Schedule testing when remediation is complete to confirm the space is clear and safe.

## When Is Clearance Required or Recommended?

Clearance is often required by insurers after mold remediation so they have proof that the area was successfully cleaned. Some contractors or remediators also require it before they consider the job complete. Even when it is not required, clearance is recommended after any significant mold remediation so you have documentation that the space is safe for reoccupation—useful for your own peace of mind, for real estate disclosure, or for tenants or family members. Schedule clearance testing when remediation is complete and the area has been dried; do not schedule before the remediator has finished and the space is ready for inspection, or the clearance may fail and need to be redone.

## Summary

Post-remediation mold clearance is testing done after mold removal to confirm the area is clean and safe for reoccupation. A qualified inspector collects air and sometimes surface samples and compares results to baseline levels. Schedule clearance testing when remediation is complete so you have documentation that the space is clear.
