faqs:
  - question: Is professional leak detection worth the cost?
    answer: In most cases, yes—especially when the leak is hidden. Paying to pinpoint the exact location often costs less than opening multiple walls, jackhammering the wrong spot, or letting water damage spread.
  - question: What does a leak detection service usually include?
    answer: A non-invasive inspection using tools like acoustic listening, thermal imaging, moisture mapping, and line tracing—plus a clear “mark-out” or written finding showing where the leak is and what type of line it’s on.
  - question: How much does professional leak detection typically cost?
    answer: Pricing varies by region and complexity, but it’s usually a flat diagnostic fee or a scope-based price. The important comparison is total cost—detection plus one targeted repair vs. multiple exploratory openings and repairs.
  - question: When is leak detection not necessary?
    answer: If the leak is visible and accessible—like a dripping shutoff valve under a sink—repair is often the first step. Detection is most valuable when the source is hidden (slab, wall, ceiling, buried line) or intermittent.
  - question: Can leak detection help with insurance documentation?
    answer: Often, yes. A documented leak location and cause can support a claim and help you get accurate repair estimates, especially for hidden leaks like slab or behind-wall pipe failures.

Professional leak detection is **usually worth the cost** when you have signs of a hidden leak but can’t see the source. The value isn’t just “finding a leak”—it’s avoiding the most expensive part of many leak repairs: **trial-and-error demolition** and the secondary damage that happens while you wait.

If you’re deciding whether to schedule detection, think of it as paying for certainty: one targeted opening, one targeted repair, and a cleaner path for your plumber (and potentially your insurer) to follow.

## Quick answer: when it pays off

Professional leak detection tends to pay for itself when:

- You have **high water bills**, but no visible leak
- You hear water **running or dripping** when nothing is on
- You suspect a **slab leak** or a leak **behind walls/ceilings**
- The leak is **intermittent** and hard to catch
- You’ve already paid for a repair and symptoms **came back**
- You need clarity before a renovation, sale, or insurance claim

If you can already see the leak (for example, a dripping compression fitting under a sink), you may not need detection first—you may need a straightforward repair.

## What you get for the fee (and what you should ask for)

A professional leak detection visit typically includes:

- **Symptom review** (bills, meter behavior, where you see staining, odors, warm spots)
- **Non-invasive testing** to narrow the zone (moisture mapping, thermal imaging, acoustic listening, line tracing)
- A clear conclusion: **where the leak most likely is** and **what line it’s on** (hot, cold, recirculation, drain, sewer, irrigation)
- A **mark-out** (marking the location on the floor/wall) and/or **written findings**

When you schedule, ask these two questions up front:

- **Will I get a mark-out or written report?**
- **Will you confirm whether it appears active right now?**

## The real comparison: total cost, not just the detection fee

It’s easy to compare:

- Option A: **Skip detection** → open wall/floor “where it makes sense,” repeat if wrong
- Option B: **Detect first** → open one small area where evidence points, then repair

Option A often turns into multiple costs:

- Labor for multiple openings
- Drywall/flooring repair and repainting
- Delays while damage spreads (mold risk, swelling/warping, staining)
- A second visit when the first repair didn’t fix the real leak

Detection is most valuable in high-risk scenarios like a suspected [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or behind-wall pipe failure where “guess and cut” can get expensive fast.

## What affects pricing (so you can get an accurate quote)

Most companies price leak detection based on complexity, not a per-minute stopwatch. Common factors include:

- **How many areas** you want checked (one room vs. whole home)
- Whether the issue looks like a **supply leak** vs. **drain/sewer** issue
- **Slab/buried lines** vs. exposed plumbing
- Whether the leak is **intermittent** (may require more testing)
- Access constraints (cleanouts, shutoffs, finishes, furniture)

Even without quoting numbers here, the key principle holds: detection should reduce the number of openings and the amount of finish work you have to repair.

## How to get the most value from your appointment

Before the technician arrives:

- Take a photo of your **most recent water bill(s)** (showing the spike)
- Do a simple **meter test** if you can: with everything off, see if the meter still moves
- Note **where symptoms appear** (warm spot, stain, odor, bubbling paint)
- If safe, identify your **main shutoff** so you can act quickly if needed

If you’re in a gray area—visible moisture but unclear source—detection can still prevent the “open three spots” scenario.

## Bottom line

Professional leak detection is usually worth it because it reduces guesswork, limits property damage, and helps your plumber make **one targeted repair** instead of multiple exploratory openings. If you have hidden-leak symptoms (bills, sounds, warm/damp spots, staining), schedule detection first—then repair with confidence.
