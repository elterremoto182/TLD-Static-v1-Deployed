    answer: 'Yes. A sewer camera can miss damage if it cannot travel the full line—for example, if a severe blockage or collapse stops the camera, or if there is no cleanout access. In that case, cleaning may be needed first, or a different access point may be required. Your technician can explain what was and was not visible.'

# Can Sewer Camera Inspections Miss Damage?

Yes. A sewer camera can miss damage if it cannot travel the full line—for example, if a severe [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) stops the camera, or if there is no cleanout access. Cleaning may be needed first, or a different access point may be required. Knowing the limits helps you understand what was and was not visible and when to retest.

## When the Camera Cannot See the Full Line

The camera can only show what it passes. If a severe blockage—grease, roots, or debris—fills the pipe, the camera may not be able to go beyond it, so damage farther down the line is not visible. If the pipe has fully collapsed, the camera stops at the collapse and cannot see what is beyond. If there is no cleanout or the only access is through a toilet or limited opening, the camera may not reach the full length of the line. In those cases, cleaning may be needed first to open the line so the camera can travel farther, or a second access point (for example, at the property line) may be required. Your technician can explain what was and was not visible and recommend next steps—for example, cleaning and then reinspection.

[Professional sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can explain what was and was not visible. Schedule an inspection and ask about [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) and full-line coverage so you know the limits of what was inspected.

## What to Ask Your Technician After the Inspection

When the inspection is done, ask whether the camera traveled the full length of the line or stopped at a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/). If the camera did not reach the end, ask whether cleaning first and then reinspection is recommended so the rest of the line can be seen. Get a written report or video that states what was and was not visible so you have a record for repair quotes or future reference. Knowing the limits of the inspection helps you avoid assuming the entire line was seen when damage may exist beyond the camera's reach.

## Summary

Sewer camera inspections can miss damage if the camera cannot pass a blockage or reach the full line. Cleaning first or using a different access point may be needed. Your technician can explain what was and was not visible and recommend next steps.
