## About Hibiscus Island

Hibiscus Island is one of Miami's most exclusive residential islands, located in Biscayne Bay between Miami and Miami Beach. Connected by the Venetian Causeway, this prestigious community features stunning waterfront estates with breathtaking views.

However, the same waterfront location that makes Hibiscus Island so desirable also creates unique challenges for homeowners—particularly when it comes to water intrusion.

## What Is Water Intrusion?

Water intrusion occurs when water enters a building where it shouldn't. Unlike a visible pipe leak, water intrusion often involves moisture penetrating through walls, foundations, windows, or roofing systems. This can happen gradually over time, making it difficult to detect until significant damage has occurred.

On waterfront properties like those on Hibiscus Island, water intrusion is especially common due to:

- **High humidity levels** that cause condensation inside wall cavities
- **Storm surge and flooding** during hurricane season
- **Salt air exposure** that deteriorates seals and waterproofing
- **Tidal fluctuations** affecting foundation drainage
- **Heavy rainfall** combined with aging waterproofing systems

## Warning Signs of Water Intrusion

If you own a waterfront home on Hibiscus Island or nearby Miami Beach areas, watch for these warning signs:

- Musty or moldy odors, especially after rain
- Peeling or bubbling paint on walls
- Staining or discoloration on ceilings and walls
- Warped or buckled flooring
- Efflorescence (white mineral deposits) on concrete or masonry
- Increased humidity inside the home
- Visible mold growth in corners or closets
- Soft spots in drywall

## How We Detect Water Intrusion

At Total Leak Detection, we use advanced non-invasive technology to locate water intrusion without damaging your property. Our methods include:

**Thermal Imaging** – Our infrared cameras detect temperature differences in walls and ceilings that indicate hidden moisture, even behind finished surfaces.

**Moisture Meters** – Electronic sensors measure moisture levels in building materials to pinpoint exactly where water has penetrated.

**Visual Inspection** – Our experienced technicians know exactly where to look for the subtle signs of water intrusion that most homeowners miss.

## Protecting Your Hibiscus Island Home

Water intrusion left unaddressed can lead to serious problems including structural damage, mold growth, and decreased property value. For luxury homes on Hibiscus Island, early detection is essential to protect your investment.

If you suspect water intrusion at your Hibiscus Island property—or any waterfront home in the Miami Beach area—don't wait for the problem to get worse.
