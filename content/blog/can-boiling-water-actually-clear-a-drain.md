    answer: 'Boiling water can sometimes help with minor grease or soap buildup in the trap or near the drain opening. It will not clear serious blockages, roots, or buildup deep in the line, and it can damage PVC pipes if poured too quickly. For persistent clogs, professional drain cleaning or hydro jetting is more effective and safer.'

# Can Boiling Water Actually Clear a Drain?

Boiling water can sometimes help with minor grease or soap buildup near the drain opening. It will not clear serious [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), and it can damage PVC if poured too quickly. Knowing when boiling water helps—and when it does not—helps you decide when to call a professional.

## When Boiling Water May Help

Boiling water can soften or dissolve minor grease or soap buildup in the trap or near the drain opening. Pouring a pot of boiling water down the drain once in a while may help keep the trap clear in a kitchen or bathroom sink. It is a low-cost, low-risk option for very mild buildup.

Boiling water will not clear serious blockages—grease or debris deep in the line, roots, or a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) in the main line. It also will not fix a [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) or offset joint. Pouring boiling water too quickly into PVC pipes can cause thermal stress and cracking, so if you use it, pour slowly. For persistent clogs, [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) is safer and more effective. Schedule an inspection if boiling water or store-bought cleaners do not work so you can get the right fix.

## When to Skip Boiling Water and Call a Pro

If the drain is completely stopped (water backs up when you run the faucet), boiling water will not clear it and may splash back. If you have PVC pipes, avoid dumping a full pot quickly; thermal shock can crack the pipe. If you have tried boiling water and the clog persists, or if multiple drains are slow (which can point to a main line or [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/)), skip further DIY and schedule [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) or a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) to identify and fix the cause safely.

## Summary

Boiling water can help with minor grease or soap buildup near the drain but will not clear serious blockages or roots and can damage PVC if poured too quickly. For persistent clogs, schedule [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) so you can get the right fix safely.
