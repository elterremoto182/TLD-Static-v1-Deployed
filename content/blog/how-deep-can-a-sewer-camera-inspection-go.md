    answer: 'A sewer camera inspection can typically travel the full length of the main sewer line from the cleanout (or access point) to the street connection—often 50 to 200 feet or more, depending on your property. Depth underground does not limit the camera; cable length and access points do. Your technician can confirm how far your line can be inspected.'

# How Deep Can a Sewer Camera Inspection Go?

A sewer camera inspection can typically travel the full length of the main sewer line from the cleanout to the street—often 50 to 200 feet or more, depending on your property. Depth underground does not limit the camera; cable length and access points do. Knowing the limits helps you understand what can be inspected and what might block the camera.

## What Determines How Far the Camera Can Go

The camera is pushed through the pipe on a flexible cable. How far it can go depends on the length of the cable (many systems have 100 to 300 feet or more) and where the line is accessed. The typical access point is a cleanout—a capped opening on the main line, often near the house or at the property line. From there, the camera is fed toward the street (or septic tank) until it reaches the end of the line or cannot go farther—for example, because of a severe blockage or collapse. Depth underground does not limit the camera; the cable runs inside the pipe, so whether the pipe is 3 feet or 10 feet deep does not change how far the camera can travel. If your line is long or has multiple segments, your technician can confirm how far your line can be inspected and whether a second access point is needed.

[Professional sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can reveal [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) and [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) along the line. Schedule an inspection and ask your technician how far your line can be inspected so you know what will be covered.

## When the Camera Cannot Reach the End

If a severe [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) stops the camera before it reaches the street connection, the technician will report how far they went and what they saw. In that case, [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) may be needed first to clear the line so a follow-up inspection can view the rest of the pipe. Alternatively, a second access point—for example, at the property line—may allow the camera to inspect from the other direction. Ask your technician what portion of your line was visible and whether cleaning or a different access point is recommended to see the full length.

## Summary

A sewer camera can typically travel the full length of the main line from cleanout to street—often 50 to 200 feet or more. Depth underground does not limit the camera; cable length and access do. Ask your technician how far your line can be inspected when you schedule.
