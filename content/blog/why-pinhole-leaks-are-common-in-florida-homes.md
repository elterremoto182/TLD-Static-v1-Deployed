# Why Pinhole Leaks Are Common in Florida Homes

Pinhole leaks—small holes in copper or other pipes—are common in Florida due to aggressive water chemistry, age of plumbing, and soil conditions. They often appear in walls or under slabs and can cause slow, hidden damage. Understanding why they occur helps you recognize the signs and when to call a leak detection specialist.

## Why Florida Homes See So Many Pinhole Leaks

Florida water is often slightly acidic or has mineral content that can corrode copper pipes from the inside over time. That corrosion can create small holes—pinholes—that allow water to escape. Older plumbing is more likely to have thinned or corroded sections. Soil conditions in Florida—including high moisture and certain soil chemistry—can also affect pipes buried in the ground or under slabs, accelerating corrosion from the outside. Pinhole leaks often start small and may go unnoticed until you see unexplained moisture, stains, higher water bills, or the sound of running water when nothing is on.

[Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) can locate pinhole leaks before they lead to [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) situations. Technicians use acoustic, thermal, and electronic methods to pinpoint the leak without opening walls or slabs. If you notice unexplained moisture or higher bills in a Florida home, schedule an inspection so the source can be found and repaired.

## What to Do If You Find One Pinhole Leak

Because pinhole leaks are often caused by corrosion that can affect other sections of the same pipe or system, finding one pinhole may mean others exist or could develop. After repairing the located leak, your plumber may recommend monitoring or replacing other sections of copper pipe, especially in older Florida homes. A leak detection inspection can find the active leak; your plumber can advise on the condition of the rest of the system and whether proactive replacement is worth considering.

## When to Schedule Leak Detection for Pinhole Suspicions

Schedule [professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) if you notice unexplained moisture or staining on walls or ceilings, a persistent increase in your water bill, the sound of running water when no fixture is on, or warm or damp spots on floors (for hot water lines). In Florida homes with older copper plumbing, these signs often point to pinhole leaks. Non-invasive detection can pinpoint the source so repair can be targeted—often with minimal wall or slab opening—and your plumber can advise whether other sections of the system should be monitored or replaced to prevent future leaks.

## Summary

Pinhole leaks are common in Florida due to water chemistry, age of plumbing, and soil conditions. They can cause hidden damage in walls and under slabs. Schedule professional leak detection if you notice unexplained moisture or higher bills so the source can be found and repaired before damage worsens.
