# Blog Publish Waves

Draft posts are created with `draft: true` in frontmatter. They do not appear on the blog index, category/tag pages, or sitemap until `draft` is set to `false` (or removed).

## Wave 1 (publish first)

**Leak Detection (25)** + **Mold Testing (15)** = 40 posts.

Set `draft: false` or remove the `draft` line from frontmatter for these slugs, then rebuild and deploy.

## How to publish

1. Open the `.md` file in `content/blog/` for the slug you want to publish.
2. Change `draft: true` to `draft: false` or delete the `draft` line.
3. Save and commit. Rebuild and deploy so the post appears on the site, blog index, category/tag pages, and sitemap.

You can publish all posts in a wave at once or spread them over days/weeks by editing frontmatter and deploying as needed.
