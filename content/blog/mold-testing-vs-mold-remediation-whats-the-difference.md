# Mold Testing vs Mold Remediation: What's the Difference?

Mold testing identifies whether mold is present, where it is, and often what type—through air, surface, or bulk samples. Mold remediation removes or contains the mold and fixes the moisture source. Testing usually comes first so remediation can be targeted. Both are important, but they serve different steps in solving a mold problem.

## What Mold Testing Does

Mold testing answers the question: is there mold, and where? A professional collects air samples, surface samples (swabs, tape lifts), or bulk samples (pieces of material) and sends them to a lab for analysis. The results show spore counts, types of mold, and often where the problem is concentrated. Testing can confirm visible mold, find hidden mold behind walls or in HVAC systems, or establish a baseline before or after remediation. It does not remove mold; it identifies it so you and your remediator know what you are dealing with.

[Professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) can guide [water damage mold](/problems/water-damage-mold/) and [hidden mold](/problems/hidden-mold/) cleanup. Schedule testing before remediation so you know what you are dealing with. Once you have the results, a remediator can remove or contain the mold and fix the moisture source; post-remediation testing can confirm the cleanup was successful.

## Can the Same Company Do Both?

In many regions, the same company is not allowed to do both testing and remediation for the same job—to avoid conflict of interest. Testing is done by a licensed mold assessor; remediation is done by a licensed remediator. You may use one company for testing and another for remediation, or a company that offers only one of the two. The key is to get testing first so remediation is based on a clear picture of what is present and where.

## When to Schedule Testing and Remediation

Schedule [professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) when you notice odor, visible mold, or past water damage so you have a clear assessment before hiring a remediator. After remediation, schedule post-remediation clearance testing to confirm the area is clean—many insurers and remediators require it. Doing testing first ensures remediation is targeted and that you have documentation for insurance or real estate; doing clearance after ensures the job is complete and the space is safe for reoccupation.

## Summary

Mold testing identifies whether mold is present and where; mold remediation removes or contains it and fixes the moisture source. Testing usually comes first so remediation can be targeted. Schedule [professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) before remediation so you know what you are dealing with.
