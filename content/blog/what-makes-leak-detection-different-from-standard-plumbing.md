# What Makes Leak Detection Different From Standard Plumbing?

Leak detection focuses on finding the exact location of a hidden leak using acoustic, thermal, and electronic equipment—before any repair work. Standard plumbing focuses on repairing or replacing pipes and fixtures once the problem is known. Both are valuable, but they serve different steps in solving a leak: detection finds it, plumbing fixes it.

## What Leak Detection Specialists Do

Leak detection specialists are trained to locate leaks that are not visible—behind walls, under slabs, or in buried lines. They use acoustic listening devices to hear water escaping from pipes, thermal imaging cameras to spot temperature differences caused by moisture, and electronic equipment to trace pipes and pinpoint leaks. The deliverable is typically a report or markout showing where the leak is, and often whether it is active. No repair is performed at this stage; the goal is accuracy of location so that when repairs are done, they can be minimal and targeted.

[Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) locates [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) and [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) without guesswork. That reduces the need for exploratory demolition and helps plumbers—or the same company if they offer both services—make a single, focused repair.

## How Standard Plumbing Fits In

Standard plumbers install and repair pipes, fixtures, and appliances. They fix leaks once the source is known—for example, replacing a section of pipe under a slab or repairing a fitting behind a wall. When the leak is hidden, many plumbers will either open walls or slabs in likely areas (trial and error) or recommend a leak detection service first. Having detection done before repair ensures the plumber knows exactly where to work, which can save time, cost, and unnecessary damage.

If you have a hidden leak, schedule detection first so repairs can be targeted and less invasive. Once the leak is located, your plumber or the same provider can perform the repair.

## Can the Same Company Do Both?

Some companies offer both leak detection and plumbing repair; others specialize in detection only and refer repair work to plumbers. Either way, the sequence is the same: detection first to locate the leak, then repair. If one company does both, they can schedule detection and repair in a logical order. If you use a detection-only company, you will receive a report or markout to share with your plumber so the repair can be planned. The important step is having the leak located before any walls or slabs are opened.

## When to Skip Detection and Call a Plumber Directly

For visible leaks—a dripping faucet, a leaking toilet tank, a burst pipe in the open, or a leak at a visible fitting—a plumber can repair directly without leak detection. Detection is for hidden leaks: when you have signs (high bills, sounds, moisture, stains) but no visible source. In those cases, [professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) finds the source so the plumber can make one targeted repair instead of opening multiple areas. If you can see exactly where the leak is, call a plumber; if you cannot, schedule detection first.

## Summary

Leak detection and standard plumbing are complementary: detection finds the leak, plumbing fixes it. For visible leaks—a dripping faucet, a burst pipe in the open—a plumber can repair directly. For hidden leaks—behind walls, under slabs, or in buried lines—professional leak detection locates the source first, so the plumber can make a single, targeted repair instead of multiple exploratory openings. Knowing the difference helps you choose the right service and avoid unnecessary cost and damage.
