# What Causes Sudden Water Pressure Drops in a Home?

Sudden water pressure drops can be caused by a leak diverting water, a clog in the line, a failing pressure regulator, or municipal supply issues. A leak is a common cause when pressure drops across multiple fixtures. Understanding the possible causes helps you decide when to call a plumber or a leak detection specialist.

## Common Causes of Sudden Pressure Drops

A leak in the main supply line or a major branch can divert water before it reaches your fixtures, so you notice a drop in pressure—especially when more than one fixture is affected. A [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) under the slab or in a wall can have the same effect. Clogs in the line—for example, mineral buildup or debris—can restrict flow and reduce pressure. A failing pressure regulator (if your home has one) can cause sudden drops or spikes. Municipal supply issues—main breaks, maintenance, or high demand—can also cause temporary pressure drops, but those usually affect the whole neighborhood.

[Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) can find hidden leaks that affect pressure. If pressure dropped suddenly and you cannot find the cause—for example, no visible leak at fixtures and no known supply issue—schedule an inspection so the source can be located and repaired.

## When to Call Leak Detection vs. a Plumber

If the pressure drop is limited to one fixture, the cause is often a clogged aerator, a failing fixture, or a branch-line issue—a plumber can usually address that. If multiple fixtures are affected and you have ruled out a municipal outage (check with neighbors or the water utility), a leak or clog in the main supply or a major branch is likely. In that case, leak detection can locate a hidden leak; a plumber can clear a clog or repair a regulator. If you are unsure, describe your situation to both: many leak detection companies and plumbers can advise whether you need detection, repair, or both.

## Why Fixing the Cause Restores Pressure and Saves Water

A leak that diverts water before it reaches your fixtures not only lowers pressure but also wastes water and can cause [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) damage over time. Locating and repairing the leak restores pressure and stops the waste. Ignoring the drop can lead to higher bills and worsening damage. [Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) finds the source so a single, targeted repair can fix both the pressure issue and the underlying leak.

## Summary

Sudden water pressure drops can be caused by leaks, clogs, pressure regulator failure, or supply issues. When multiple fixtures are affected and no visible leak or supply problem is found, schedule leak detection to find hidden leaks that may be diverting water. Addressing the cause restores pressure and prevents further damage.
