# When Slow Drains Signal a Bigger Plumbing Problem

When multiple drains are slow at once, the problem is usually in the main line—a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/), [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/). A single slow drain may be a local clog; multiple slow drains point to the main. Recognizing when slow drains signal a bigger problem helps you act before a full backup occurs.

## When to Suspect a Main Line Issue

A single slow drain—for example, only the kitchen sink or only one shower—often indicates a local clog in that fixture's branch. Clearing that branch (with a snake or drain cleaner) may resolve it. When multiple fixtures are slow at the same time—toilets, sinks, showers, or tubs—the problem is usually downstream of all of them, in the main sewer line. That can be a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) (grease, debris, roots), [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) (roots growing into the pipe), or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) (a failed section of pipe). Ignoring the problem can lead to a full backup—wastewater backing up into the home—and higher repair costs. Addressing it early with [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) or a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can clear the line or document what repair is needed.

[Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) can clear the main line. A sewer camera inspection can show what is causing the problem. Schedule an inspection before it becomes a full backup so you can plan the right fix.

## Why Not Just Use a Chemical Cleaner?

Chemical drain cleaners may temporarily improve flow in a single fixture but rarely fix a main line [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/). They can also damage pipes with repeated use. When multiple drains are slow, the blockage or damage is usually beyond the reach of chemicals—and you need to know whether the cause is grease, roots, or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) so you can choose the right fix. [Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) with snaking or hydro jetting, and a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) when the cause is unclear, address the main line properly and reduce the chance of repeat problems.

## Summary

When multiple drains are slow at once, the problem is usually in the main line—a blockage, roots, or pipe damage. Schedule [drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) or a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) before it becomes a full backup so you can plan the right fix.
