# When a Sewer Camera Inspection Is Necessary

A sewer camera inspection is necessary when you have recurring backups, slow drains in multiple fixtures, sewage odors, or before buying a home. It shows what is inside the line so you can decide on cleaning or repair. Knowing when to schedule one helps you avoid guesswork and unnecessary expense.

## Situations That Warrant an Inspection

When multiple fixtures are slow—for example, more than one toilet, sink, or shower—the problem is often in the main line rather than a single branch. A sewer camera inspection can show whether the cause is a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/), [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/). Recurring backups after cleaning suggest an underlying problem (roots, bellied pipe, or damage) that a camera can reveal. Sewage odors indoors or in the yard can indicate a break or blockage in the line; an inspection can locate the source. Before buying a home, a sewer camera inspection can uncover hidden defects so you are not surprised after the sale. Before committing to costly repairs—such as line replacement—an inspection documents what is wrong and where, so you can get accurate quotes and choose the right fix.

[Professional sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can reveal root intrusion, pipe collapse, or sewer blockage. Schedule an inspection before committing to costly repairs so you know exactly what is inside the line.

## What If You Skip the Inspection?

Skipping an inspection and guessing at the cause—for example, paying for repeated drain cleaning when the real issue is [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/)—can waste money and leave the problem unresolved. Without a camera, you do not know the location or extent of damage, so repair quotes may be vague or inflated. Scheduling a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) first gives you a clear picture, accurate repair options, and documentation for insurance or real estate. The cost of the inspection is usually modest compared to the cost of unnecessary or wrong repairs.

## Summary

A sewer camera inspection is necessary when you have recurring backups, slow drains in multiple fixtures, sewage odors, or before buying a home. It shows what is inside the line so you can plan cleaning or repair. Schedule an inspection before committing to costly repairs.
