# Sewer Camera Inspection vs Drain Cleaning: What's the Difference?

A sewer camera inspection shows the inside of the pipe—cracks, roots, blockages, and damage—without clearing anything. Drain cleaning (snaking or hydro jetting) clears blockages but does not show the pipe condition. Often inspection is done first to see what is wrong, then cleaning or repair follows. Both are valuable, but they do different jobs.

## What Each Service Does

A sewer camera inspection is diagnostic. A small camera is fed through the main sewer line on a cable, and the technician views live video of the pipe interior. The inspection reveals cracks, [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/), [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/), offset joints, and scale—but it does not clear blockages or repair the pipe. Drain cleaning clears blockages. Snaking uses a flexible auger to break through or pull out debris; hydro jetting uses high-pressure water to scour the pipe and clear grease, roots, and buildup. Cleaning restores flow but does not show you what is inside the pipe or whether there is structural damage. For that reason, many professionals recommend inspection first—so you know whether the problem is a simple blockage or something that requires repair—then cleaning or repair based on what the camera shows.

[Professional sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) helps diagnose root intrusion and sewer blockage. For [drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) after inspection, schedule both so you know what you are dealing with and can choose the right fix.

## When to Get Both

Many homeowners schedule inspection first when they have slow drains or backups and are unsure of the cause. The camera shows whether the problem is a simple [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) (cleaning may be enough), [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) (cleaning plus root treatment), or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) (repair or replacement). After inspection, you can schedule [drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) with confidence, or you may learn that repair is needed instead of or in addition to cleaning. Some companies offer inspection and cleaning in the same visit; ask when you schedule so you can plan the right sequence and avoid paying for cleaning when the line needs repair.

## Summary

Sewer camera inspection shows what is inside the pipe; drain cleaning clears blockages. Often inspection is done first so you know the cause, then cleaning or repair follows. Schedule inspection when you have slow drains or backups so you can choose the right fix.
