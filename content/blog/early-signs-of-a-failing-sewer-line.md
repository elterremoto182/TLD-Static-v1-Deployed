# Early Signs of a Failing Sewer Line

Early signs of a failing sewer line include slow drains in multiple fixtures, gurgling in toilets or drains, sewage odors indoors or in the yard, and recurring backups. If you notice these signs, a sewer camera inspection can show what is going on inside the line. Catching problems early can limit damage and repair cost.

## Warning Signs to Watch For

When more than one fixture is slow—toilets, sinks, showers, or tubs—the problem is often in the main sewer line rather than a single drain. Gurgling in toilets or drains when you run water elsewhere can indicate a partial blockage or venting issue in the main line. Sewage odors indoors or in the yard can point to a break, leak, or blockage that is allowing sewer gas to escape. Recurring backups—especially after you have already had the line cleaned—suggest an underlying issue such as [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), a bellied pipe, or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/). Wet spots or sinkholes in the yard near where the line runs can indicate a broken or leaking pipe. If you notice any of these signs, a sewer camera inspection can show what is inside the line so you can address it before the problem gets worse.

[Professional sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can reveal root intrusion, pipe collapse, or [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/). Schedule an inspection before the problem gets worse so you can plan the right repair.

## Why Acting Early Saves Money

Addressing early signs with a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) lets you see whether the cause is [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) (often treatable with cleaning and root treatment), [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) (cleaning may be enough), or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) (repair or replacement). Catching a problem when it is still a partial blockage or a small section of damage often means one cleaning or spot repair instead of a full line replacement or emergency work after a complete backup. Delaying until the line fails completely usually means higher cost, more disruption, and possible sewage backup into the home. Schedule an inspection as soon as you notice the warning signs.

## Summary

Early signs of a failing sewer line include slow drains in multiple fixtures, gurgling, sewage odors, and recurring backups. Schedule a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) when you notice these signs so you can see what is inside the line and plan the right repair.
