faqs:
  - question: Is hydro jetting better than snaking?
    answer: It depends. Hydro jetting is usually more thorough for grease buildup and recurring main-line issues because it cleans the full pipe wall. Snaking is often enough for a simple, localized clog.
  - question: When should I choose snaking instead of hydro jetting?
    answer: Choose snaking for single-fixture clogs, when pipe condition is unknown or fragile, or when a camera inspection suggests damage that could make jetting risky.
  - question: Do I need a sewer camera inspection before hydro jetting?
    answer: Often, yes—especially for older homes or recurring problems. A camera inspection helps confirm the pipe is intact enough for high-pressure jetting and identifies what’s actually causing the clog.
  - question: Can hydro jetting remove tree roots?
    answer: Jetting can clear some root intrusions and wash debris out, but roots often return unless the entry point is repaired. Heavy root intrusion or damaged pipe may require repair, not just cleaning.
  - question: How do I prevent clogs after cleaning?
    answer: Avoid grease down drains, use strainers, flush lines appropriately, and address underlying issues (roots, bellies, offset joints). Recurring clogs often indicate a structural problem that a camera can reveal.

Most drain problems boil down to two goals:

1. **Restore flow now** (stop the backup/slow drain)
2. **Reduce recurrence** (so you’re not paying for the same clog again)

Snaking and hydro jetting can both restore flow—but they work differently and they’re not interchangeable. The right choice depends on what’s inside the pipe and how healthy the pipe is.

## How Each Method Works

Snaking (drain augering) uses a flexible cable with a cutting head that is fed through the drain. The cable breaks through blockages—grease, debris, roots—and opens a path for flow. It is effective for many clogs and is often used for single-fixture blockages or when access is limited. It does not clean the full circumference of the pipe; it opens a hole through the blockage. Hydro jetting uses a hose with a specialized nozzle that shoots high-pressure water into the pipe. The water scours the inside of the pipe, removing grease, scale, roots, and debris along the full length. It is more thorough for [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) and [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) in the main line and can help prevent recurring clogs by cleaning the pipe wall. Not all pipes are suitable for hydro jetting—old, fragile, or already damaged pipes may be at risk—so a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) is often recommended first.

[Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) can recommend the right method. Schedule an inspection so you get the best option for your situation—snaking for a simple clog, or hydro jetting for a thorough main-line cleaning when the pipe is in good condition.

## The key difference: “punch through” vs. “fully clean”

Think of snaking as a tool that **punches a channel** through the blockage so water can flow again. Think of jetting as a tool that **scrubs the pipe walls** to remove buildup that causes recurring clogs.

That’s why:

- Snaking can solve a clog quickly but may leave residue behind.
- Jetting takes longer and costs more, but can provide a “reset” for greasy or scaled pipes—when the pipe is in good condition.

## When snaking is usually the better choice

Snaking is often the right first step when:

- Only **one fixture** is affected (one sink or tub)
- The clog is likely hair/soap/debris close to the drain opening
- You need a fast restore of flow and the problem is not recurring
- Pipe condition is unknown and you want a safer, lower-pressure approach

Snaking can also be used as a “get access back” step if a main line is blocked so severely that a camera can’t pass.

## When hydro jetting is usually the better choice

Hydro jetting is often the better choice when:

- The clog is in the **main line** and problems are recurring
- The line has heavy grease buildup (common in kitchen lines)
- You’re dealing with repeated [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) symptoms
- You want a more thorough cleaning to reduce recurrence

Jetting can also help flush fine debris that snaking doesn’t fully remove.

## Why Pipe Condition Matters Before Choosing

Hydro jetting uses high pressure that can crack or damage old, fragile, or already compromised pipes. Before recommending jetting, many technicians suggest a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) to confirm the pipe is in good enough condition. If the camera shows [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/), severe cracks, or offset joints, snaking may be the safer option to open a path, or repair may be needed instead of cleaning. [Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) that starts with an inspection ensures you get the method that is both effective and safe for your pipe.

## Why a camera inspection is a big deal for recurring clogs

Recurring clogs often indicate something structural:

- [Root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/)
- Offset joints
- A belly holding water
- [Pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/)

Cleaning can restore flow temporarily, but those issues tend to come back. A camera inspection tells you whether you’re dealing with “buildup” (cleaning problem) or “damage” (repair problem).

## What results should you expect after each service?

### After snaking

- Flow is restored
- Some residue may remain on the pipe wall
- If recurrence happens, it’s a sign to escalate to camera inspection and/or jetting

### After hydro jetting

- Flow is restored
- Pipe walls are cleaner (less grease/scale residue)
- If recurrence happens, it often points to structural issues that need repair

## Questions to ask your technician (to get the right recommendation)

- Is this likely a branch-line clog or a main-line issue?
- Is pipe condition known (age/material/history)?
- Do you recommend a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) first—and why?
- If jetting is recommended, what pressure/nozzle strategy will be used?
- If roots are present, what’s the long-term plan beyond cleaning?

## Bottom line

Snaking is often best for simple, localized clogs and quick flow restoration. Hydro jetting is typically best for recurring main-line issues and heavy buildup because it cleans the full pipe wall—but it should be chosen carefully based on pipe condition. If clogs keep coming back, the safest path is usually: **camera inspection → choose the right cleaning method → repair any structural defects**.
