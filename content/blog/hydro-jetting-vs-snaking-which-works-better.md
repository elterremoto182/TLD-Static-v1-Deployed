# Hydro Jetting vs Snaking: Which Works Better?

Hydro jetting uses high-pressure water to clear and clean the inside of the pipe; snaking uses a cable to break through blockages. For [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), hydro jetting often does a more thorough job. For a single fixture clog, snaking may be enough. Knowing the difference helps you choose the right method for your situation.

## How Each Method Works

Snaking (drain augering) uses a flexible cable with a cutting head that is fed through the drain. The cable breaks through blockages—grease, debris, roots—and opens a path for flow. It is effective for many clogs and is often used for single-fixture blockages or when access is limited. It does not clean the full circumference of the pipe; it opens a hole through the blockage. Hydro jetting uses a hose with a specialized nozzle that shoots high-pressure water into the pipe. The water scours the inside of the pipe, removing grease, scale, roots, and debris along the full length. It is more thorough for [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) and [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) in the main line and can help prevent recurring clogs by cleaning the pipe wall. Not all pipes are suitable for hydro jetting—old, fragile, or already damaged pipes may be at risk—so a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) is often recommended first.

[Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) can recommend the right method. Schedule an inspection so you get the best option for your situation—snaking for a simple clog, or hydro jetting for a thorough main-line cleaning when the pipe is in good condition.

## Why Pipe Condition Matters Before Choosing

Hydro jetting uses high pressure that can crack or damage old, fragile, or already compromised pipes. Before recommending jetting, many technicians suggest a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) to confirm the pipe is in good enough condition. If the camera shows [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/), severe cracks, or offset joints, snaking may be the safer option to open a path, or repair may be needed instead of cleaning. [Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) that starts with an inspection ensures you get the method that is both effective and safe for your pipe.

## Summary

Hydro jetting cleans the full pipe and is often better for main-line blockages and roots; snaking opens a path and is often enough for single-fixture clogs. Your technician can recommend the right method. Schedule an inspection so you get the best option for your situation.
