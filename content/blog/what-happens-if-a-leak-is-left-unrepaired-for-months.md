# What Happens If a Leak Is Left Unrepaired for Months?

If a leak is left unrepaired for months, you risk mold growth, damaged drywall or flooring, higher water bills, and in severe cases foundation or structural issues. Repair costs and health risks increase the longer the leak continues. Understanding the consequences helps you act before the problem grows.

## Damage That Builds Over Time

Water that escapes from a leak and soaks into walls, floors, or soil does not simply disappear. Over months, it can support mold growth, which can affect indoor air quality and health. Drywall, subfloor, and framing can soften, warp, or rot. Paint may peel and stains may spread. If the leak is under a slab or near the foundation, water can erode soil or cause heaving, leading to cracks in the slab or foundation and in severe cases structural damage. Your water bill will also reflect the ongoing waste, and the cost of repair—including mold remediation, structural repair, and plumbing—rises the longer the leak continues.

[Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) finds the source so it can be repaired. Ignoring a [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [toilet leak](/problems/toilet-leak/) can turn a small fix into a major project. Schedule an inspection as soon as you suspect a problem so the leak can be located and repaired before damage escalates.

## The Cost of Waiting

The longer you wait, the more you may spend. A leak that could have been repaired with one targeted fix may eventually require mold remediation, drywall or flooring replacement, or in slab cases, foundation repair. Insurance may not cover damage that is deemed long-term or maintenance-related. Acting early—scheduling leak detection and repair as soon as you notice signs—limits the scope of damage and often keeps repair costs and claims simpler.

## Signs You Should Not Ignore

Do not wait for obvious flooding to act. Signs of a hidden leak include unexplained increases in your water bill, musty odors, soft or discolored spots on walls or floors, the sound of running water when no fixture is on, or warm spots on the floor (for hot water lines). If you notice any of these, schedule [professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) so the source can be located and repaired before months of damage accumulate. Early detection keeps repairs smaller and reduces the risk of mold and structural issues.

## Summary

An unrepaired leak can lead to mold, damaged materials, higher bills, and in severe cases foundation or structural issues. The sooner you locate and repair the leak, the less damage and cost you face. Schedule professional leak detection as soon as you suspect a problem.
