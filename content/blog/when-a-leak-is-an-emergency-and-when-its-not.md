# When a Leak Is an Emergency — and When It's Not

A leak is an emergency when water is gushing, flooding, or spreading quickly—shut off the main and call for help. A slow or hidden leak—higher bills, sounds, or moisture with no flooding—usually can wait for a scheduled [professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) visit. Knowing the difference helps you respond appropriately and avoid unnecessary panic or delay.

## When a Leak Is an Emergency

A leak is an emergency when water is actively gushing, flooding a room, or spreading quickly. In those cases, shut off the main water supply to the home and call for help immediately—either a plumber who offers emergency service or a leak detection company that can respond the same day. [Slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) that is actively flooding is an emergency. So is water spraying from a broken pipe, a rapidly rising water meter with all fixtures off, or visible water spreading across floors or into walls. The goal is to stop the flow and limit damage as soon as possible.

Do not wait to shut off the main if you can safely reach it. If you are unsure where the main shutoff is or cannot turn it off, call for emergency service and describe what you see; the team can advise whether to come out immediately or schedule.

## When You Can Schedule Normally

A slow or hidden leak—unexplained high water bills, sounds of running water when nothing is on, damp or warm spots on floors, or stains and mold with no visible source—usually is not an emergency. Water is not flooding; the problem has been present for some time and is likely to continue at a similar rate until it is found and repaired. In those cases, scheduling a [professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) visit within a few days is appropriate. The technician will locate the leak so repairs can be planned and done in a targeted way.

Waiting a few days for a scheduled visit does not mean ignoring the problem. You can still shut off water to specific fixtures or zones if that reduces the flow from a suspected leak, and you can monitor the situation. The key is that no water is actively flooding the home or spreading in a way that requires same-day response.

## Gray Areas: When to Call and Ask

Some situations fall in between. For example, you might have a small but visible drip from a pipe that has been leaking for a while, or a toilet that occasionally overflows. If you are unsure whether your situation is an emergency, call and describe what you see: where the water is, whether it is spreading, and whether you have shut off the main. The team can advise whether to come out immediately or schedule a normal visit. Many companies would rather take a quick call than have you delay an actual emergency.

## What to Do Right Now

If you have an emergency: locate your main water shutoff (often near the meter or where the main enters the home), turn it off, and call for help. If you have a slow or hidden leak: note your signs (which fixtures, where you hear or see moisture, any change in your water bill), then schedule a [professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) visit. If you are unsure: call and describe what you see so the team can advise the right response. Treat a leak as an emergency when water is gushing or flooding; for everything else, a scheduled inspection is usually the right next step.

## After an Emergency: Still Get Detection If the Source Was Hidden

If you had an emergency—for example, you shut off the main and a plumber made a temporary repair—but the exact source of a [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) was not fully documented, scheduling [professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) afterward can still help. Detection can confirm the full extent and location of the leak so that the permanent repair is done in the right place and any related damage is accounted for. That is especially useful when the emergency fix was in one area but you want to be sure there are no other weak spots in the line.
