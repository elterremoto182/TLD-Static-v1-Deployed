# Leak Detection Before Selling a Home: Is It Necessary?

Leak detection before selling is not always required, but it can uncover hidden [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) issues before a buyer's inspection. Fixing leaks in advance can avoid renegotiation or lost deals. Knowing when it is worth scheduling helps you prepare your home for sale.

## When Leak Detection Before Selling Makes Sense

Leak detection is not typically required by law before listing a home, but it can be a smart move in several situations. If your home has older plumbing—especially copper pipes in a region like South Florida where pinhole leaks are common—a pre-listing inspection can find hidden leaks before a buyer's inspector does. If you have had moisture issues, stains, or unexplained high water bills in the past, a leak detection visit can confirm whether problems were fully resolved. Finding and repairing leaks before listing gives you a clear picture of your plumbing and can avoid surprises during the buyer's inspection.

[Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) gives you a clear picture of your plumbing before listing. If your home is older or you have had moisture issues, scheduling an inspection can be a smart move. You can then disclose what you know and, if you choose, repair any issues before the sale so the transaction stays on track.

## Disclosure and Negotiation

If leak detection finds a problem, you can choose to repair it before listing or disclose it and let the buyer factor it into the offer. In either case, you avoid the surprise of a buyer's inspection turning up a hidden leak late in the process, when it can lead to renegotiation or a lost deal. Some buyers also request a sewer camera inspection; having already addressed known plumbing and leak issues can simplify that conversation and show that you have been proactive.

## What a Pre-Listing Leak Inspection Includes

A pre-listing [leak detection](/leak-detection/) visit typically involves the same non-invasive methods used for any hidden leak: listening for leak sounds, checking for moisture in walls or under slabs, and sometimes thermal imaging. The technician will look for active leaks and signs of past moisture that could indicate an unresolved issue. You will receive a report that you can use to decide whether to repair before listing or to disclose. Scheduling early in your selling timeline gives you time to complete any repairs and retest if needed before the first showing or buyer inspection.

## Summary

Leak detection before selling is not legally required but can uncover hidden slab or pipe issues before a buyer's inspection. It is especially useful for older homes or those with a history of moisture issues. Schedule an inspection to get a clear picture of your plumbing and to repair or disclose any issues before the sale.
