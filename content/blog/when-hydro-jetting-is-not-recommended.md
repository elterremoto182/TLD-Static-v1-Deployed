# When Hydro Jetting Is Not Recommended

Hydro jetting is not recommended when the pipe is severely damaged or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) is suspected—high pressure can worsen damage. An inspection with a [sewer camera](/sewer-camera-inspection/) is often done first to confirm the line can be jetted. Knowing when hydro jetting is not recommended helps you avoid damage and choose the right fix.

## When Hydro Jetting Can Be Risky

Hydro jetting uses high-pressure water to scour the inside of the pipe. That pressure can crack or damage pipes that are already weak—for example, old clay or cast iron pipes, pipes with existing cracks or offset joints, or pipes that have partially collapsed. If [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) is present, hydro jetting can worsen the collapse or cause a full breach. For that reason, many professionals recommend a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) before hydro jetting so the pipe condition is known. If the pipe is severely damaged or collapsed, snaking may be used to open a path, or repair or replacement may be needed instead of jetting. Hydro jetting is also not recommended when the line has not been inspected—you do not want to jet a pipe that may be fragile or already failed.

[Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) can recommend the right method for [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/). Schedule an inspection so you get the safest and most effective option—snaking, hydro jetting, or repair—based on your pipe condition.

## What to Do Instead When Jetting Is Not an Option

When the pipe is too damaged for hydro jetting, the technician may recommend snaking to open a path and restore flow—snaking uses less pressure and is gentler on fragile pipes. For [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) or severe damage, repair or replacement is usually required; no amount of cleaning will fix a collapsed section. A [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) documents the condition so you can get accurate repair quotes. In some cases, the line can be lined (trenchless repair) instead of dug up. Scheduling an inspection first ensures you get the right solution—cleaning, repair, or replacement—instead of risking further damage with the wrong method.

## Summary

Hydro jetting is not recommended when the pipe is severely damaged or collapsed—high pressure can worsen damage. A [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) is often done first to confirm the line can be jetted. Schedule an inspection so you get the safest option for your pipe condition.
