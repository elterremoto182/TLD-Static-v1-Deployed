    answer: 'No. When water dries, the pipe or fitting that is leaking is still damaged. The leak will continue when water runs again and can cause repeated damage, mold, and higher bills. The source of the leak must be located and repaired by a professional.'

# Can a Water Leak Dry On Its Own Without Repairs?

Water can dry up, but the leak does not. The crack, hole, or loose fitting remains, so the leak returns the next time water flows and can cause repeated damage and mold. Drying is not a substitute for repair; the source must be located and fixed.

## Why Drying Is Not Enough

When a leak stops flowing—for example, if you shut off the water or the leak is intermittent—the visible water may evaporate and surfaces may dry. That can make it seem as if the problem has gone away. But the damage to the pipe or fitting is still there. The next time water runs through that line, the leak will start again. Over time, repeated wetting and drying can lead to mold growth, rot, stains, and structural damage. The only permanent fix is to find the leak and repair or replace the affected section of pipe or fitting.

[Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) finds the source so it can be repaired correctly. Ignoring it can lead to [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [water heater leak](/problems/water-heater-leak/) issues and higher repair costs later. Schedule an inspection and repair instead of hoping it will go away.

## What If the Leak Seems to Have Stopped?

Sometimes a leak appears to stop—for example, after you shut off water to a zone or fixture, or during a dry period. The pipe or fitting is still damaged; as soon as water runs through that line again, the leak can return. Do not assume that because things have dried or the leak is intermittent, no repair is needed. Locate and repair the source so you are not dealing with repeated damage, mold, and higher bills. A professional can find the leak even if it is not currently flowing, by running water to the line during the inspection or by assessing residual moisture and damage.

## How Leak Detection Finds Leaks That Are Not Currently Flowing

[Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) can often locate a leak even when it is not actively dripping. Technicians may run water to pressurize the line during the inspection so the leak produces sound or moisture that can be detected. They can also look for residual moisture, staining, or temperature differences that point to the source. For [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) situations, correlators and acoustic equipment can narrow down the location so repair can be targeted. Do not delay scheduling because the leak seems to have stopped—the damage is still there and will cause problems again when water flows.

## Summary

No—a water leak does not fix itself when things dry. The damaged pipe or fitting remains and the leak will return when water flows again. The only permanent fix is to locate the source and repair or replace it. Schedule leak detection and repair instead of hoping the problem will go away.
