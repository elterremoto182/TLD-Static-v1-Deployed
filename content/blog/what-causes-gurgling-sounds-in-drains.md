# What Causes Gurgling Sounds in Drains?

Gurgling in drains usually means air is trapped in the line—often due to a partial [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) or a vent problem. When water flows past the blockage, air bubbles back up and causes the gurgle. Understanding the causes helps you decide when to schedule drain cleaning or a sewer camera inspection.

## Why Drains Gurgle

Drain pipes are designed to allow wastewater to flow while letting air escape through vent stacks that extend to the roof. When something blocks the flow or the vent, air can become trapped. When water runs down the drain, it pushes the trapped air ahead of it or past the blockage; the air bubbles back up through the water in the trap, producing a gurgling sound. A partial [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) in the main line can cause this—water and air are forced through a narrow opening, and air bubbles back up through other fixtures. A blocked or damaged vent stack can also trap air and cause gurgling in multiple drains. In some cases, [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) creates a partial blockage that leads to gurgling.

[Professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) can clear the blockage. If root intrusion or pipe collapse is suspected, a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can confirm. Schedule an inspection if gurgling persists so you can address the cause and restore normal flow.

## One Drain vs. Multiple Drains: What It Tells You

If only one drain gurgles—for example, just the bathroom sink—the cause may be local to that fixture (a partial clog in that branch or its vent). If multiple drains gurgle, especially when you flush the toilet or run a different fixture, the cause is often in the main line or the main vent. That points to a [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/), [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) in the main line, or a blocked vent stack. In that case, [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) or a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can identify and fix the problem so all fixtures drain and vent properly again.

## Summary

Gurgling in drains usually means trapped air—often from a partial blockage or vent problem. Schedule [drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) to clear blockages; if roots or pipe damage are suspected, a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) can confirm. Address the cause so flow and venting return to normal.
