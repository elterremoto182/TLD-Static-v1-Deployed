# Do All Plumbers Offer True Leak Detection?

Not all plumbers offer true leak detection. General plumbers often repair visible leaks or open walls in likely spots. Leak detection specialists use acoustic, thermal, and electronic equipment to pinpoint the source before any repair work. Understanding the difference helps you choose the right service when you have a hidden leak.

## What General Plumbers Typically Do

General plumbers install and repair pipes, fixtures, and appliances. When you have a visible leak—a dripping faucet, a leaking toilet, or a burst pipe in the open—they can fix it. When the leak is hidden behind a wall or under a slab, many plumbers will either open the wall or floor in the most likely area and look for the leak (trial and error), or they will refer you to a leak detection company. Not all plumbers own or use acoustic correlators, thermal imaging cameras, or electronic pipe tracers; those tools are more commonly used by specialists who focus on finding leaks first.

[Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) locates [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) and [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) without guesswork. Specialists use acoustic, thermal, and electronic methods to pinpoint the leak before any repair work, so repairs can be targeted and less invasive. If you need the leak found first, schedule an inspection with a leak detection specialist; once the location is known, the same company or your plumber can perform the repair.

## How to Know If You Need a Specialist

If you have a hidden leak—signs like high bills, sounds of water, or damp spots but no visible source—ask the plumber or company whether they perform leak detection with specialized equipment (acoustic, thermal, electronic) or whether they recommend a separate leak detection company. Many plumbers will refer you to a specialist for location and then handle the repair. Getting the leak located first is the key; who does the repair can be the same company or your regular plumber.

## What Specialists Use That General Plumbers May Not

Leak detection specialists typically use ground microphones and electronic correlators to listen for leak sounds and pinpoint the location along the pipe; thermal imaging cameras to spot temperature differences caused by escaping water; and sometimes pipe tracers or moisture meters to map pipes and damp areas. These tools allow them to locate [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) and [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) without opening walls or slabs first. General plumbers may have some of these tools, but specialists use them daily and are trained to interpret the results. If the company you call does not offer non-invasive location and instead suggests opening walls in "likely" spots, consider calling a dedicated leak detection company for the locate, then your plumber for the repair.

## Summary

Not all plumbers offer true leak detection with specialized equipment. General plumbers repair visible leaks or may open walls in likely spots. Leak detection specialists locate the source first using acoustic, thermal, and electronic methods. For hidden leaks, schedule detection first so repairs can be targeted; then your plumber or the same provider can do the repair.
