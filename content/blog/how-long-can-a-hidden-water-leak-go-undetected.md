    answer: 'A small hidden leak can go undetected for months or even years, especially if it is behind walls or under the slab. Slow leaks often show no obvious signs until damage—such as mold, stains, or higher bills—becomes noticeable. Professional leak detection can locate leaks early before major damage occurs.'

# How Long Can a Hidden Water Leak Go Undetected?

A hidden water leak can go undetected for weeks, months, or in some cases years—especially when it is behind walls, under the slab, or in an unused area of the home. Slow leaks often produce no visible water until you notice higher bills, stains, or mold. Knowing how long leaks can go unnoticed helps you act when you do see signs.

## Why Hidden Leaks Stay Hidden

Leaks behind walls, under slabs, or in crawl spaces are out of sight. A small leak may not create a puddle or any visible water; the water may soak into materials or flow along a path you never see. You may not notice the problem until your water bill rises, you see a stain or mold, you hear running water when nothing is on, or you feel a warm or damp spot on the floor. In some cases, a leak has been present for months or years before any of these signs become obvious. The longer it goes undetected, the more damage it can cause.

Scheduling [professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) helps locate leaks early, before major damage occurs. Left unchecked, leaks can lead to [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) damage or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) risks. If you suspect a hidden leak—for example, unexplained high bills or sounds of water when nothing is on—have it located and repaired before the problem grows.

## What to Do If You Suspect a Hidden Leak

Do not wait for obvious damage. As soon as you have a reason to suspect a leak—a higher bill, sounds of water when nothing is on, or damp spots—schedule a leak detection inspection. The technician can confirm whether a leak is present and where it is, even if it has been there for a long time. The sooner you find and repair it, the less damage it can cause. There is no benefit to waiting; hidden leaks do not fix themselves and tend to worsen or cause more damage over time.

## Can Leak Detection Find Old or Inactive Leaks?

[Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) can often locate a leak that has been present for a long time. Technicians may run water to activate the leak so it produces sound or moisture, or they may use residual moisture, staining, or thermal patterns to infer the source. Even if the leak is intermittent, a thorough inspection can usually identify the area so repair can be planned. Do not assume that because the leak has been "quiet" for a while it is gone or unfindable—schedule an inspection so you can get a definitive location and repair it before [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) damage grows.

## Summary

Hidden water leaks can go undetected for weeks, months, or even years when they are behind walls or under slabs. Schedule professional leak detection as soon as you have signs—high bills, sounds, or moisture—so the leak can be located and repaired before major damage occurs.
