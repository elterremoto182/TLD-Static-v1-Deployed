# Sewer Inspections Before Buying a Home: What to Know

A sewer camera inspection before buying a home can reveal [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/), or [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) that a standard home inspection does not cover. It can help you negotiate or plan for repairs. Knowing what to expect and when to schedule helps you protect your investment.

## Why a Sewer Inspection Before Buying Matters

A standard home inspection typically does not include a camera inspection of the main sewer line. The inspector may run water and check for visible leaks, but they do not feed a camera through the pipe to see cracks, roots, or collapse. Hidden defects in the main line can cause backups, odors, and costly repairs after you move in. A pre-purchase sewer camera inspection shows the condition of the main line from the cleanout to the street—or as far as the camera can travel—so you know whether [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/), or [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/) is present. With that information, you can negotiate with the seller, request repairs, or budget for repair after closing. Schedule the inspection during the due diligence period so you have time to review results and decide before closing.

[Professional sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) gives you a clear picture of the main line before closing. Schedule an inspection during the due diligence period so you know what you are buying and can plan accordingly.

## Who Pays and When to Schedule

Sewer camera inspections are often paid for by the buyer as part of due diligence, similar to a home inspection—though you can sometimes negotiate with the seller to share or cover the cost. Schedule the inspection as early in the due diligence period as possible so you have time to review the report or video, get repair quotes if needed, and negotiate or walk away before the deadline. The inspector will need access to the cleanout (usually in the yard or basement); confirm with your agent or the seller that access is available. If the report shows [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/), or major [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/), you can use it to request repairs, a credit, or a price reduction, or to budget for repair after closing.

## Summary

A sewer camera inspection before buying can reveal root intrusion, pipe collapse, or blockages that a standard home inspection does not cover. Schedule during the due diligence period so you can negotiate or plan for repairs before closing.
