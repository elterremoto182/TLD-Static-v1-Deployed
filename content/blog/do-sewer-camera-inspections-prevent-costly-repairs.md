# Do Sewer Camera Inspections Prevent Costly Repairs?

A sewer camera inspection does not fix the pipe by itself, but it finds problems early—[root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/), [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/), [sewer blockage](/problems/sewer-blockage/)—so you can plan targeted cleaning or repair instead of waiting for an emergency. In that sense, inspection helps you avoid costly emergency repairs by catching issues before they become critical.

## How Inspection Reduces Cost and Risk

When you have slow drains or backups, you could guess and pay for cleaning or repair without knowing the cause—and sometimes the problem returns because the underlying issue (roots, collapse, bellied pipe) was not addressed. A sewer camera inspection shows what is inside the line so you can choose the right fix: cleaning to clear a blockage, root treatment to slow regrowth, or repair or replacement of a damaged section. Planning repair based on what the camera shows often means a single, targeted fix instead of repeated cleanings or emergency work when the line fails completely. Inspection also documents the condition of the line for insurance, real estate, or future reference.

[Professional sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) gives you a clear picture of the line. Schedule an inspection when you notice slow drains or backups so you can avoid costly emergency repairs later by addressing problems early.

## Best Times to Schedule an Inspection

Scheduling a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) before you have a full backup or collapse gives you the most options. Good times include when you first notice slow drains or gurgling, before buying a home so you know the line condition, after buying an older home for baseline documentation, or when you are planning a major renovation and want to avoid surprises. Waiting until the line backs up or fails often means emergency service, limited repair choices, and higher cost. Early inspection lets you plan cleaning, spot repair, or replacement on your timeline and budget.

## Summary

Sewer camera inspections find problems early so you can plan targeted cleaning or repair instead of waiting for an emergency. Schedule an inspection when you notice slow drains or backups to avoid costly emergency repairs later.
