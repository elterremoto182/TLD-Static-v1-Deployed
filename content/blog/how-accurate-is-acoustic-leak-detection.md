    answer: 'Acoustic leak detection is highly accurate for locating pressurized water leaks in pipes. Technicians use ground microphones or correlators to pick up the sound of escaping water and pinpoint the leak location, often within a few feet. It works best when pipes are pressurized and ambient noise is low.'

# How Accurate Is Acoustic Leak Detection?

Acoustic leak detection is very accurate for finding pressurized water leaks. Technicians listen for the sound of escaping water and use correlators to narrow down the location, often within a few feet. When conditions are right, it is one of the most reliable non-invasive methods for pinpointing leaks in pipes.

## How Acoustic Leak Detection Works

Technicians use ground microphones, handheld listening devices, or electronic correlators to pick up the sound of water escaping from a pipe. That sound—often a hiss or drip that is hard to hear with the naked ear—travels along the pipe and through the surrounding material. By placing sensors at two or more known points (for example, at fixture connections or cleanouts), a correlator can calculate the time difference of the leak sound arriving at each sensor and pinpoint the leak location along the line. Accuracy is typically within a few feet, which is enough to limit repair to a small section of wall or slab.

Accuracy is best when the pipe is pressurized and water is flowing, and when ambient noise (traffic, appliances, HVAC) is low. [Professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) often combines acoustic methods with thermal or electronic tools for [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) and [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) situations. If you suspect a hidden leak, schedule an inspection to get an accurate location before repair.

## When Acoustic Detection Is Combined With Other Methods

In practice, technicians often use acoustic detection together with thermal imaging or electronic correlators. For example, acoustic equipment may narrow the leak to a section of pipe, and thermal imaging may then confirm the exact spot by showing a temperature difference. Or correlators may give a distance reading, and a ground microphone may be used to verify the location. Combining methods improves accuracy and is common for slab leaks and complex layouts. Your technician will choose the right combination based on your situation.

## When Acoustic Detection May Be Less Effective

Acoustic leak detection works best when water is flowing through the pipe (so the leak produces sound) and when background noise is low. If the leak is very slow or the water has been shut off, the sound may be too faint to detect. Very noisy environments—busy streets, loud HVAC, or multiple people in the home—can also interfere. In those cases, [professional leak detection](/leak-detection/) may use other methods (thermal imaging, moisture mapping, or running water to activate the leak) or schedule the inspection for a quieter time. Your technician can explain the best approach for your [slab leak](/problems/slab-leak/) or [pipe burst](/problems/pipe-burst/) situation.

## Summary

Acoustic leak detection is highly accurate for pressurized water leaks when conditions are favorable—water flowing and low ambient noise. It can pinpoint leaks within a few feet, so repairs can be targeted. For the best results, schedule a professional inspection that can use acoustic and other methods as needed to locate your leak before repair.
