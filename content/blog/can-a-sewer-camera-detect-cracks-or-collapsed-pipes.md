# Can a Sewer Camera Detect Cracks or Collapsed Pipes?

Yes. A sewer camera inspection shows the inside of the pipe in real time—cracks, breaks, offset joints, and collapsed sections. The technician can pinpoint the location and extent of damage so repairs can be targeted. Camera inspection is the standard way to assess pipe condition before repair or replacement.

## What the Camera Shows

A sewer camera is fed through the pipe on a flexible cable and sends live video to a monitor. Cracks in the pipe wall—hairline or wider—are visible. Breaks or holes where the pipe has failed are clear. Offset or separated joints, where two pipe sections have shifted apart, show up as gaps or misalignment. Collapsed sections—where the pipe has caved in and no longer has an open bore—are visible; the camera may not be able to pass beyond a full collapse. The technician can measure the distance from the access point so the location of any damage is documented for repair. That allows you to get accurate quotes and plan targeted repair (for example, spot repair or line replacement) instead of guessing.

[Professional sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) helps diagnose [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) and [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) before costly repairs. Schedule an inspection if you have backups or slow drains so you know exactly what is inside the line.

## What Happens After the Camera Finds Damage

Once the technician documents cracks, collapse, or offset joints, you can use that information to get accurate repair quotes. Plumbers or sewer repair companies can recommend spot repair (lining or point repair) or full line replacement based on the location and extent of damage. Having the camera footage or report avoids guesswork and ensures the repair targets the right section. If the damage is minor, cleaning and monitoring may be an option; if it is severe, you can plan replacement before a full failure. Scheduling a [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) when you first notice problems gives you time to compare options and avoid emergency pricing.

## Summary

Yes—a sewer camera can show cracks, breaks, offset joints, and collapsed sections inside the pipe in real time. Schedule an inspection if you have backups or slow drains so you can plan targeted repair or replacement.
