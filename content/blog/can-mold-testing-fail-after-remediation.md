# Can Mold Testing Fail After Remediation?

Yes. Post-remediation clearance testing can fail if mold was not fully removed, moisture remains, or new growth has started. In that case, additional remediation and moisture control are needed before retesting. Understanding why clearance fails helps you fix the problem and pass on the next round.

## Why Clearance Testing Can Fail

Post-remediation clearance testing is done after mold removal to confirm the area is clean. Air and sometimes surface samples are taken and compared to baseline or outdoor levels. Clearance can fail if mold was not fully removed—for example, mold remains in a cavity or behind a surface that was not fully addressed. It can also fail if moisture remains; mold will grow back if the moisture source was not fixed. In some cases, new growth has started because drying was incomplete or a new leak occurred. When clearance fails, the report and the testing professional can help identify why—elevated spore counts in a particular area, moisture readings, or visible growth—so you know what to fix.

[Professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) can identify why clearance failed and what to fix. Additional remediation and moisture control are usually needed before retesting. If you had [water damage mold](/problems/water-damage-mold/) or [hidden mold](/problems/hidden-mold/) remediation, schedule testing to confirm the space is clear, and if it fails, follow the recommendations before retesting.

## What to Do When Clearance Fails

When clearance fails, the report should indicate where spore counts were elevated or where moisture or visible mold was found. Share the report with your remediator so they can address those areas—for example, remove remaining mold, improve drying, or fix the moisture source. Do not retest until the remediator has completed the additional work and the area has been dried. Retesting too soon can lead to another failure and extra cost. [Professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) can explain the results and recommend what to fix before the next clearance visit so you have a clear path to passing.

## Summary

Yes—clearance testing can fail if mold remains, moisture is still present, or new growth has started. When it fails, the report will help you and your remediator address the cause before retesting. Schedule [professional mold testing](/mold-testing/) after remediation to confirm the space is clear, and follow up with any recommended fixes if clearance does not pass.
