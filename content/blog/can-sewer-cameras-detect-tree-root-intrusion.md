# Can Sewer Cameras Detect Tree Root Intrusion?

Yes. A sewer camera inspection shows the inside of the pipe in real time, and tree roots are visible as they enter through cracks or joints. The technician can pinpoint where roots are and how severe the intrusion is. Camera inspection is the standard way to confirm root intrusion and plan cleaning or repair.

## How Roots Appear on Camera

Tree roots seek moisture and nutrients and can grow into sewer lines through small cracks or at pipe joints. Once inside, they can branch and fill the pipe, causing blockages and eventually damaging the pipe. A sewer camera fed through the line shows the interior in real time; roots are visible as dense, hairlike or root-like growth, often entering at a joint or crack. The technician can note the distance from the access point so the location is documented. That allows you to decide on the right fix—for example, mechanical cleaning (snaking or hydro-jetting) to clear roots, root treatment to slow regrowth, or repair or replacement of the damaged section. In some cases, [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/) is present along with roots and may require more extensive repair.

[Professional sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) is the standard way to diagnose [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) and pipe collapse. Schedule an inspection if you have slow drains or backups and trees near the line so you know exactly what is inside the pipe.

## After the Camera Confirms Roots: Your Options

Once the camera shows roots, the technician can recommend the right fix. Light root growth may be cleared with snaking or [professional drain cleaning](/services/drain-cleaning/) and may be followed by root treatment (foam or chemical treatment to slow regrowth). Heavier [root intrusion](/problems/root-intrusion/) may need hydro jetting to clear the line, and if roots have damaged the pipe—cracks or [pipe collapse](/problems/pipe-collapse/)—repair or replacement of that section may be needed so roots cannot re-enter. A [sewer camera inspection](/sewer-camera-inspection/) documents the location and severity so you can get accurate quotes and choose cleaning, root treatment, or repair.

## Summary

Yes—a sewer camera shows tree roots inside the pipe in real time. The technician can pinpoint where roots are and how severe the intrusion is. Schedule an inspection if you have slow drains or backups and trees near the line so you can choose the right fix.
