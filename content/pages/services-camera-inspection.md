- **Recurring issues** that never get properly fixed
- **Hidden damage** that gets worse over time
- **Property damage** from invasive exploratory work

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is a sewer camera inspection?

A sewer camera inspection is a non-invasive diagnostic procedure that involves inserting a high-resolution waterproof camera into your home's sewer line. The camera transmits real-time video footage, allowing professionals to identify issues such as blockages, cracks, root intrusions, and pipe deterioration without digging.

### 2. When is it necessary to conduct a sewer line inspection?

We recommend scheduling a sewer camera inspection for persistent clogs, sewer backups, slow drains, or foul odors. Additionally, when purchasing a new home, it's crucial to arrange a comprehensive inspection to evaluate the condition of your sewer lines.

### 3. How frequently should I arrange a sewer camera inspection?

The frequency depends largely on the age of your plumbing system. Typically, consider scheduling a sewer camera inspection service annually to detect issues before they escalate into costly plumbing repairs. Older homes (20+ years) should be inspected more frequently.

### 4. Can I perform a sewer camera inspection myself?

**We don't recommend it!** While it's possible to conduct a sewer camera inspection independently, standard homeowner-level inspection devices lack auto-focus and only examine the initial few feet of the pipeline. Our professional-grade video scopes and locator units are self-righting and high resolution, ensuring efficient detection of signs of damage.

### 5. What are the advantages of a sewer inspection?

A sewer camera inspection is a cost-effective and time-saving measure that can spare you from future headaches. Our skilled plumbers install a high-resolution camera that thoroughly examines your sewer line, identifies potential problems like clogs, tree root intrusion, and broken pipes. This proactive approach allows for early detection and timely resolution, preventing extensive damage to your home.

### 6. How do sewer cameras work?

Sewer cameras utilize a small waterproof camera on a flexible cable, feeding live images to a laptop for a clear view of the drainage system. They work in underground pipes, including those beneath house foundations and encased in concrete, offering a non-invasive solution for detecting and addressing current issues or preventing future problems.

### 7. How long does a sewer camera inspection take?

Most inspections take between 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the complexity of the system and the length of the sewer line. We provide detailed reports the same day.

### 8. Are you available for emergencies?

**Yes, we offer 24/7 emergency sewer camera inspection services.** If you have a sewer backup, persistent clogs, or urgent plumbing issues, call us immediately. We understand the importance of quick and reliable service in emergency situations.
