## Why Drains Clog

![Clogged drain showing buildup that causes drainage problems](/images/services/clog.jpg)

Understanding what causes clogs helps you prevent them and choose the right cleaning approach.

### Common Clog Culprits

**Kitchen Drains**
- **Grease and cooking oils**: Solidify as they cool, coating pipe walls
- **Food particles**: Even with garbage disposals, debris accumulates
- **Soap scum**: Combines with grease to form stubborn deposits
- **Coffee grounds**: Don't break down and accumulate over time

**Bathroom Drains**
- **Hair**: The #1 cause of bathroom clogs, combines with soap to form masses
- **Soap residue**: Creates sticky buildup that catches other debris
- **Toothpaste and personal products**: Contribute to gradual buildup
- **Hygiene products**: Items that should never be flushed

### Deeper System Issues

**Main line problems:**
- Tree root intrusion
- Pipe deterioration and corrosion
- Bellied or sagging pipes
- Buildup from years of use

**Venting issues:**
- Blocked vent pipes affect drainage throughout the house
- Can cause gurgling, slow drains, and odors

### Florida-Specific Factors

- **Hard water**: Mineral deposits narrow pipes over time
- **Older plumbing**: Many Florida homes have 30-50 year old drain systems
- **Tree roots**: Year-round growing season means aggressive root intrusion
- **Heavy use**: Frequent entertaining and guests stress plumbing systems

---

## Types of Drain Problems

### Slow Drains

Water drains, but takes longer than normal. Usually indicates:
- Partial blockage developing
- Buildup narrowing the pipe
- Venting problems
- Multiple drains slow = main line issue

### Complete Blockages

Water won't drain at all. Causes include:
- Solid obstruction (foreign object, collapsed pipe)
- Severe buildup
- Tree root mass
- Main line backup

### Recurring Clogs

The same drain clogs repeatedly. Suggests:
- Underlying problem not fully addressed
- Pipe damage trapping debris
- Root intrusion that keeps growing back
- Improper usage habits

### Multiple Drain Problems

Several drains affected simultaneously indicates:
- Main sewer line issue
- Venting problem
- Septic system backup (if applicable)

### Gurgling and Odors

Strange sounds or sewage smells signal:
- Venting issues
- Partial blockages
- Sewer gas escaping through dry traps
- Main line problems

## DIY Drain Cleaning Methods

Some drain issues respond to home remedies, but know when to stop and call professionals.

### Safe DIY Approaches

**Boiling Water**
Effective for minor grease buildup. Pour slowly, let it work, repeat if needed. Don't use on PVC pipes with standing water—trapped boiling water can soften plastic.

**Baking Soda and Vinegar**
A gentle, pipe-safe option:
1. Pour 1/2 cup baking soda down the drain
2. Follow with 1/2 cup white vinegar
3. Cover and wait 15-30 minutes
4. Flush with hot water

**Plunger**
Proper technique matters:
- Use a flange plunger for toilets
- Use a cup plunger for sinks
- Ensure good seal before plunging
- Push and pull vigorously

**Drain Snake (Hand Auger)**
For accessible clogs:
- Insert carefully to avoid pipe damage
- Rotate while pushing forward
- Pull out debris, don't push it deeper
- Clean thoroughly after use

### What to Avoid

**Chemical Drain Cleaners**
Most plumbers discourage chemical cleaners because they:
- Can damage pipes, especially older systems
- Create dangerous fumes
- Often don't solve the real problem
- Harm septic systems
- Make professional work more dangerous

### When DIY Isn't Enough

Stop and call professionals if:
- DIY methods don't resolve the problem
- The clog returns within days or weeks
- Multiple drains are affected
- You suspect main line issues
- There are sewage odors
- Water backs up into other fixtures

## Professional Drain Cleaning Options

### Mechanical Snaking (Augering)

**How it works:**
A motorized cable with cutting head is fed into the drain to break through blockages.

**Best for:**
- Localized clogs
- Hair and debris accumulation
- Immediate relief needed
- Budget-conscious solutions

**Limitations:**
- Clears the path but doesn't clean pipe walls
- May not remove all buildup
- Roots will grow back

### Hydro Jetting

**How it works:**
High-pressure water (3,000-4,000+ PSI) scours pipe walls, removing all buildup and obstructions.

**Best for:**
- Severe buildup and grease
- Tree root cutting
- Complete pipe cleaning
- Long-term results
- Preventive maintenance

**Benefits:**
- Cleans entire pipe diameter
- Removes roots, grease, scale completely
- Longest-lasting results
- Environmentally friendly (just water)

### Video Camera Inspection

![Camera inspection reveals the inside of pipes before cleaning](/images/gallery/camera-inspection-before.jpg)

Often combined with cleaning to:
- Diagnose the problem before cleaning
- Verify results after cleaning
- Identify pipe damage that cleaning won't fix
- Locate problems precisely

## Hydro Jetting vs. Snaking

Choosing the right method depends on your situation.

### When to Choose Snaking

- **Budget concerns**: Snaking costs less
- **Minor clogs**: Simple blockages respond well
- **Quick fix needed**: Faster to complete
- **Fragile pipes**: Less pressure on older systems
- **Access limitations**: Works in tighter spaces

### When to Choose Hydro Jetting

- **Grease buildup**: Water pressure cuts through grease snaking can't
- **Root intrusion**: High pressure cuts roots effectively
- **Recurring problems**: Thorough cleaning prevents quick return
- **Commercial kitchens**: Essential for grease management
- **Preventive maintenance**: Best for keeping clean pipes clean
- **Complete cleaning**: When you want pipes as clean as possible

### Cost-Benefit Comparison

| Factor | Snaking | Hydro Jetting |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Initial Cost | Lower ($100-$300) | Higher ($300-$600) |
| Effectiveness | Good for simple clogs | Superior for all issues |
| Duration of Results | Shorter | Longer-lasting |
| Pipe Cleaning | Minimal | Complete |
| Best For | Quick fixes | Long-term solutions |

## Preventing Drain Problems

The best drain cleaning is the one you never need. Prevention is far cheaper than repair.

### Kitchen Best Practices

**Never pour down drains:**
- Cooking grease or oil (dispose in trash)
- Coffee grounds
- Eggshells
- Pasta, rice, or starchy foods
- Fibrous vegetables

**Do:**
- Run hot water after each use
- Use drain screens
- Clean garbage disposal regularly
- Wipe greasy pans before washing

### Bathroom Best Practices

**Protect your drains:**
- Use hair catchers in showers and tubs
- Don't flush anything but toilet paper
- Run water while shaving to flush whiskers
- Clean pop-up stoppers monthly

**Regular maintenance:**
- Flush drains with hot water weekly
- Use enzyme cleaners monthly (not chemical)
- Remove visible hair from drain covers

### Whole-House Strategies

**Preventive professional service:**
- Annual or bi-annual professional cleaning for older homes
- Camera inspection every 3-5 years
- Address slow drains before they become clogs

**Know your system:**
- Locate your cleanouts
- Know what your pipes are made of
- Understand where your sewer line runs

## When It's More Than a Clog

Sometimes drain problems indicate bigger issues that cleaning alone won't solve.

### Signs of Pipe Damage

- Clogs that return within weeks despite professional cleaning
- Visible pipe corrosion at exposed sections
- Sinkholes or wet spots in yard
- Foundation cracks
- Sewage odors that persist after cleaning

### When You Need More Than Cleaning

- **Bellied pipes**: Sagging sections need repair or replacement
- **Root damage**: Cleaning helps but damaged pipes need attention
- **Corroded pipes**: Eventually need replacement
- **Collapsed sections**: Require excavation and repair
