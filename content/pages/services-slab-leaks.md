# Slab Leak Detection: Protect Your Foundation Before It's Too Late

**Slab leaks are the most dangerous type of water leak—hidden under your foundation, silently destroying your home's structural integrity. Don't wait until you see the damage.**

Slab leaks occur when water pipes beneath your concrete foundation crack or corrode. These leaks can go undetected for months, causing foundation damage, mold growth, and structural problems that cost $10,000-$50,000+ to repair.

**Total Leak Detection uses advanced non-invasive technology to locate slab leaks quickly—without tearing up your foundation. Available 24/7 for emergency service.**

## The Hidden Danger: Why Slab Leaks Are So Destructive

Slab leaks are especially dangerous because they're located in a hard-to-reach area that's nearly impossible to detect without professional equipment. Water leaking under your foundation causes:

- **Foundation damage** - Water erodes soil, causing foundation cracks and settling ($15,000-$50,000+ to repair)
- **Structural damage** - Warped floors, cracked walls, and ceiling damage throughout your home
- **Mold growth** - Hidden moisture creates toxic mold that threatens your family's health
- **Skyrocketing water bills** - Undetected leaks can waste thousands of gallons monthly
- **Property value loss** - Foundation issues can reduce your home's value by 20-30%

**The average slab leak causes $10,000-$30,000 in damage** before it's even detected. Early detection saves you tens of thousands and prevents catastrophic structural failure.

**Don't let a slab leak destroy your foundation. Schedule your free inspection today.**

## Warning Signs: How to Know If You Have a Slab Leak

A slab leak can be hard to detect, but these telltale signs indicate you may have a problem:

### Immediate Red Flags:
- ✅ **Unexplained puddles of water** in your yard or around your foundation
- ✅ **Puddles accumulating on floors** inside your home
- ✅ **Floor feels warm to the touch** - especially in specific areas
- ✅ **Unexpected high water bill** - sudden spike in monthly costs
- ✅ **Water meter moving** while all water inside is turned off

### Secondary Warning Signs:
- Cracks in walls or foundation
- Warped or buckling floors
- Musty odors or visible mold
- Low water pressure throughout the house
- Sounds of running water when everything is off

**If you notice any of these signs, don't wait. Slab leaks get worse quickly and the damage compounds daily.**

## What Causes Slab Leaks?

Understanding the causes helps prevent future problems:

### 1. Ground Shifting
Florida's soil conditions cause ground to shift underneath homes, putting stress on pipes and causing cracks.

### 2. Pipe Corrosion
Copper piping reacts with concrete and soil, causing corrosion that weakens pipes over time. After years of wear, pipes become prone to cracks and leaks.

### 3. Poor Installation
Improperly installed pipes or pipes without proper protection are more susceptible to damage.

### 4. Age
Older homes (20+ years) are at higher risk as pipes deteriorate with age.

**Our advanced detection technology can locate the exact cause and position of your slab leak—without excavation.**
