# Hydro Jetting: The Powerful Solution for Stubborn Clogs

**Tired of clogs that keep coming back? Traditional methods only clear the surface—hydro jetting completely cleans your pipes from the inside out, removing years of buildup and preventing future blockages.**

Over time, clogs and blockages develop from materials like grease, soap scum, hair, and invasive tree roots. If traditional methods aren't working or the problem keeps returning, it's time for a more powerful solution.

**Total Leak Detection uses the newest, most powerful hydro jetting tools on the market to completely clear your pipes and restore optimal flow. Non-chemical, environmentally safe, and long-lasting results.**

## The Problem: Why Traditional Methods Fail

Traditional drain cleaning methods only clear the immediate blockage, leaving behind:

- **Grease buildup** that hardens and causes recurring clogs
- **Soap scum** that accumulates over time
- **Hair and debris** that gets stuck in pipe walls
- **Tree roots** that grow back after cutting
- **Mineral deposits** that reduce pipe diameter
- **Bacteria and mold** that thrive in dirty pipes

**These partial cleanings mean your clogs return within weeks or months, costing you hundreds in repeated service calls.**

**Don't waste money on temporary fixes. Hydro jetting provides a permanent solution.**

## The Hydro Jetting Solution: Complete Pipe Cleaning

![Hydro Jetting Equipment](/images/services/drain-cleaning.jpg)

Hydro jetting is a non-chemical approach to clearing and cleaning your entire piping system. It requires only high-pressure water to purge your pipes and sewer line of buildup and pollutants.

### How Hydro Jetting Works:

Our powerful hydro jetting equipment uses **pressurized water streams up to 4,000 PSI** to:

✅ **Blast away stubborn clogs** - Removes blockages that snaking can't touch  
✅ **Clean pipe walls** - Scours away years of grease, soap scum, and buildup  
✅ **Remove tree roots** - Cuts through invasive roots completely  
✅ **Eliminate bacteria** - Washes away harmful bacteria and mold  
✅ **Restore flow** - Returns your pipes to like-new condition  
✅ **Prevent future clogs** - Clean pipes mean fewer problems down the road  

**We use the newest, most powerful hydro jetting tools on the market to clear out excess debris and sediment and get your sewer lines cleared quickly.**

## The Benefits of Hydro Jetting

### 1. No Harsh Chemicals
Hydro jetting requires only high-pressure water—no toxic chemicals that harm your pipes, your health, or the environment.

### 2. Removes Buildup and Bacteria
Unlike snaking that only clears the immediate blockage, hydro jetting removes all buildup and harmful bacteria from your entire pipe system.

### 3. Cleaner, Healthier Water
Clean pipes mean cleaner water flowing through your home, reducing health risks and improving water quality.

### 4. Improved Water Pressure
Removing buildup restores proper water flow and pressure throughout your plumbing system.

### 5. Long-Term Impact
Hydro jetting provides lasting results. Clean pipes mean fewer clogs, better flow, and reduced maintenance costs for years to come.
