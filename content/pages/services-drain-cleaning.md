Most drain cleaning services are completed within 1-2 hours. Simple clogs may take less time, while more complex blockages might require additional work. We offer same-day service in most cases and 24/7 emergency service when you need it.

### 2. How much does professional drain cleaning cost?

We offer **free estimates and consultations**. Our pricing is transparent with no hidden fees. The cost depends on the severity of the clog, the cleaning method required, and accessibility. Early intervention is always more cost-effective than waiting for a complete backup.

### 3. Will drain cleaning damage my pipes?

**No, absolutely not.** We use professional-grade equipment designed for safe, effective drain cleaning. Our video inspection helps us choose the right method for your specific pipe type and condition.

### 4. Can you prevent clogs from coming back?

### 7. Can you clean main sewer line clogs?

**Yes, we specialize in main sewer line cleaning.** We use video inspection to locate the blockage, then employ professional equipment including hydro jetting to clear even the toughest main line clogs, including tree roots.
